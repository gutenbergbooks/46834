<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>The three years which have elapsed since the publication
of the first edition of this work have been
years of great activity of thought on many of the subjects
treated therein. Some changes and additions
seemed therefore imperatively called for.</p>

<p>For example: There has sprung up recently among
the foremost writers on evolution a warm discussion on
the <i>factors</i> of evolution, their number and relative importance.
I have therefore added a chapter (<a href="#CHAPTER_II_III">Chap. III,
Part II</a>) on this subject&mdash;not, indeed, to discuss it fully
(for this would be impossible in the limits of a chapter),
but to put the mind of the reader in position to understand
it and to judge for himself.</p>

<p>Again: Every reader of the first edition must have
remarked that there are many fundamental religious
questions which I have not touched at all in <a href="#PART_III">Part III</a>.
I had avoided these because my own mind was not yet
fully clear. I regarded what I then wrote as only a
little leaven in a very large lump. I was willing to
wait and let it work. In the mean time it has worked
in my own mind, and I hope in the minds of others.
I have therefore added two chapters to this part. In
one I simply carry out to their logical consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
the doctrine of the Divine Immanency. This brings
up the questions of <i>First and Second Causes</i>; of
<i>General and Special Providence</i>; of the <i>Natural and
the Supernatural</i>; of <i>Mind vs. Mechanics in Nature</i>,
etc., and shows the necessary changes of view which
are enforced by the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>In the other I take up very briefly “<i>The Relation
of Evolution to the Doctrine of the Christ</i>.” In the
discussion of this I restrain myself strictly within the
limits of the subject as stated above.</p>

<p>The only other important changes are in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_IV">Chapter IV,
Part III</a>, “<i>On the Relation of Man to Nature</i>.” As I
regard this as the most important chapter in the whole
book, I have endeavored still further to enforce my
view of the origin of man’s spirit, and especially to
make it clearer by means of several additional illustrations.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p>The subject of the following work may be expressed
in three questions: What is evolution? Is it true?
What then? Surely, there are no questions of the day
more burning than these. Much has been written on
each of them, addressed to different classes of minds:
some to the scientific, some to the popular, and some to
the religious and theological; but nothing has yet appeared
which covers the whole ground and connects
the different parts together. Much, very much has been
written, especially on the nature and the evidences of
evolution, but the literature is so voluminous, much of
it so fragmentary, and most of it so technical, that even
very intelligent persons have still very vague ideas on
the subject. I have attempted to give (1) a very concise
account of what we mean by evolution, (2) an outline
of the evidences of its truth drawn from many different
sources, and (3) its relation to fundamental religious
beliefs. I have determined, above all, to make a book
so small that it may be read through without much expense
of time and patience. But the subject is so large
that in order to do so it was necessary to sacrifice all
but what was most essential, and to forego all redundancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
(the bane of so-called popular science) even at the
risk of baldness and obscurity. Nevertheless, I hope
that the first and second parts will be found not only
interesting to the intelligent general reader, but even
profitable to the special biologist. I have tried to
make these parts as untechnical as possible, but I
hope not on that account the less scientific. For I am
among these who think that it is not necessary to be
superficial in order to be popular&mdash;that science may be
adapted to the intelligent popular mind without ceasing
to be science.</p>

<p>The third part seems to me still more important just
now. There is a deep and widespread belief in the
popular mind, and even to some extent in the scientific
mind, that there is something exceptional in the doctrine
of evolution as regards its relation to religious
thought and moral conduct. Other scientific theories
have required only some modifications of religious conceptions,
but this utterly destroys the possibility of all
religious belief by demonstrating a pure materialism.
Now this, I believe, is a complete misconception.
Thinking men are fast coming to see this; some, indeed,
have mistaken the change for a reaction against
evolution. It is a reaction not against evolution, but
only against its materialistic implication. Evolution is
more and more firmly established every year. The tide
of conviction is one which knows no ebb. Some clear
statement, in brief space, of its true relation to religious
thought seems, therefore, very important at this time.</p>

<span class="subhead">ITS SCOPE AND DEFINITION.</span></h2>

<p><b>A Type of Evolution.</b>&mdash;Every one is familiar with
the main facts connected with the development of an
egg. We all know that it begins as a microscopic germ-cell,
then grows into an egg, then organizes into a chick,
and finally grows into a cock; and that the whole process
follows some general, well-recognized law. Now,
this process is evolution. It is more&mdash;it is <i>the</i> type of
all evolution. It is that from which we get our idea of
evolution, and without which there would be no such
word. Whenever and wherever we find a process of
change more or less resembling this, and following laws
similar to those determining the development of an egg,
we call it evolution.</p>

<p><i>Universality of Evolution.</i>&mdash;Evolution as a <i>process</i> is
not confined to one thing, the egg, nor as a doctrine is
it confined to one department of science&mdash;biology. The
process pervades the whole universe, and the doctrine
concerns alike every department of science&mdash;yea, every
department of human thought. It is literally one half
of all science. Therefore, its truth or falseness, its acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
or rejection, is no trifling matter, affecting only
one small corner of the thought-realm. On the contrary,
it affects profoundly the foundations of philosophy,
and therefore the whole domain of thought. It
determines the whole attitude of the mind toward Nature
and God.</p>

<p>I have said evolution constitutes one half of all science.
This may seem to some a startling proposition. I
stop to make it good.</p>

<p>Every system of correlated parts may be studied from
two points of view, which give rise to two departments
of science, one of which&mdash;and the greater and more complex&mdash;is
evolution. The one concerns changes within
the system by action and reaction between the parts,
producing equilibrium and stability; the other concerns
the progressive movement of the system, as a whole, to
higher and higher conditions&mdash;the movement of the
point of equilibrium itself, by constant slight disturbance
and readjustment of parts on a higher plane, with
more complex inter-relations. The one concerns the
laws of sustentation of the system, the other the laws
of evolution. The one concerns things as they are, the
other the process by which they become so. Now, Nature
as a whole is such a system of correlated parts. Every
department and sub-department of Nature, whether it be
the solar system or the earth, or the organic kingdom, or
human society, or the human body, is such a system of
correlated parts, and is therefore subject to evolution.
We can best make this thought clear by examples:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
1. Take, then, the <i>human body</i>. This complex and
beautiful system of correlated and nicely-adjusted parts
may be studied in a state of maturity and equilibrium,
in which all the organs and functions by action and
reaction co-operate to produce perfect stability, health,
and physical happiness. This study is physiology. Or
else the same may be studied in a state of progressive
change. Now, we perceive that the stability is never
perfect&mdash;the point of equilibrium is ever moving. By
the ever-changing number and relative power of the co-operating
parts the equilibrium is ever being disturbed,
only to be readjusted on a higher plane, with still more
beautiful and complex inter-relations. This is growth,
development, evolution. Its study is called embryology.
2. Take another example&mdash;<i>the solar system</i>. We may
study sun, planets, and satellites in their mutual actions
and reactions, co-operating to produce perfect equilibrium,
stability, beautiful order, and musical harmony.
This is the ideal of physical astronomy as embodied in
Laplace’s “Mécanique Céleste.” Or we may study the
same in its origin and progressive change. Now, we perceive
that equilibrium and stability are never absolutely
perfect, but, on the contrary, there is continual disturbance
with readjustment on a higher plane&mdash;continual introduction
of infinitesimal discord, only to enhance the
grandeur and complexity of the harmonic relations.
This is the nebular hypothesis&mdash;the theory of the development
of the solar system. It is cosmogony; it is evolution.
3. Again: <i>society</i> may be studied in the mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
play of all its social functions so adjusted as to produce
social equilibrium, happiness, prosperity, and good government.
This is social statics. But equilibrium and
stability are never perfect. Permanent social equilibrium
would be social stagnation and decay. Therefore, we
must study society also in its onward movement&mdash;the
equilibrium ever disturbed, only to be readjusted on a
higher plane with more and more complexly inter-related
parts. This is dynamics&mdash;social progress. It is evolution.
4. Again: the <i>earth</i>, as a whole, may be studied
in its present forms, and the mutual action of all its parts&mdash;lands
and seas, mountains and valleys, rivers, gulfs,
and bays, currents of air and ocean&mdash;and the manner in
which all these, by action and reaction, co-operate to produce
climates and physical conditions such as we now
find them. This is physical geography. Or, we may
study the earth in its gradual progress toward its present
condition&mdash;the changes which have taken place in
all these parts, and consequent changes in climate; in a
word, the gradual process of becoming what it now is.
This is physical geology&mdash;it is evolution. 5. Lastly, we
may study the whole <i>organic kingdom</i> in its entirety
as we now find it&mdash;the mutual relation of different
classes, orders, genera, and species to each other and to
external conditions, and the action and reaction of these
in the struggle for life&mdash;the geographical distribution of
species and their relation to climate and other physical
conditions, the whole constituting a complexly adjusted
and permanent equilibrium. This is a science of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
importance, but one not yet distinctly conceived, much
less <span class="locked">named.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> Or, we may study the same in its gradual
progressive approach, throughout all geological times,
toward the present condition of things, by continual
changes in the parts, and therefore disturbance of equilibrium
and readjustment on a higher plane with more
complex inter-relations. This is development of the
organic kingdom. In the popular mind it is, <i>par excellence</i>,
evolution.</p>

<p>We might multiply examples without limit. There
are the same two points of view on all subjects. As
already said, in the one we are concerned with things
as they are; in the other, with the process by which
they became so. This “law of becoming” in all things&mdash;this
universal law of progressive inter-connected change&mdash;may
be called the law of continuity. We all recognize
the universal relation of things, gravitative or
other, in space. This asserts the universal causal relation
of things in <i>time</i>. This is the universal law of
evolution.</p>

<p>But it has so happened that in the popular mind the
term evolution is mostly confined to the development of
the organic kingdom, or the law of continuity as applied
to this department of Nature. The reason of this is that
this department was the last to acknowledge the supremacy
of this law; this is the domain in which the advocates
of supernaturalism in the realm of Nature had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
made their last stand. But it is wholly unphilosophical
thus to limit the term. If there be any evolution, <i>par
excellence</i>, it is evolution of the individual or embryonic
development. This is the clearest, the most familiar,
and most easily understood, and therefore the type of
evolution. We first take our idea of evolution from this
form, and then extend it to other forms of continuous
change following a similar law. But, since the popular
mind limits the term to development of the organic
kingdom, and since, moreover, this is now the battleground
between the advocates of continuity and discontinuity&mdash;of
naturalism and supernaturalism in the <i>realm
of Nature</i>&mdash;what we shall say will have reference chiefly
to this department, though we shall illustrate freely by
reference to other forms of evolution.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Definition of Evolution.</span></h3>

<p>Evolution is (1) continuous <i>progressive change</i>, (2)
<i>according to certain laws</i>, (3) and by means of <i>resident
forces</i>. It may doubtless be defined in other and perhaps
better terms, but this suits our purposes best.
Embryonic development is the type of evolution. It
will be admitted that this definition is completely realized
in this process. The change here is certainly continuously
progressive; it is according to certain well-ascertained
laws; it is by forces (vital forces) resident
in the egg itself. Is, then, the process of change in
the organic kingdom throughout geologic times like
this? Does it correspond to the definition given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
above? Does <span class="smcap smaller">IT</span> also deserve the name of evolution?
We shall see.</p>

<p>I. <b>Progressive Change.</b>&mdash;Every individual animal body&mdash;say
man’s&mdash;has become what it now is by a gradual
process. Commencing as a microscopic spherule of living
but apparently unorganized protoplasm, it gradually
added cell to cell, tissue to tissue, organ to organ, and
function to function; thus becoming more and more
complex in the mutual action of its correlated parts, as
it passed successively through the stages of germ, egg,
embryo, and infant, to maturity. This ascending series
of genetically connected stages is called the embryonic or
<i>Ontogenic</i> <span class="locked">series.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>There is another series the terms of which are coexistent,
and which, therefore, is not in any sense a genetic
or development series, but which it is important to mention,
because to some degree similar to and illustrative of
the last. Commencing with the lowest unicelled microscopic
organisms, and passing up to the animal scale, <i>as
it now exists</i>, we find a series of forms similar, though
not identical, with the last. Here, again, we find cell
added to cell, tissue to tissue, organ to organ, and function
to function, the animal body becoming more and
more complex in structure, in the mutual action of its
correlated parts, and the mutual action with the environment,
until we reach the highest complexity of structure
and of internal and external relations only in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
animals. This ascending series may be called the natural
history series; or, the classification or <i>Taxonomic series</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
The terms of this series are, of course, not genetically
connected; at least, not directly so connected. In what
way they are connected, and how the series comes to be
similar to the last, we shall see by-and-by.</p>

<p>Finally, there is still a third series, the grandest and
most fundamental of all, but only recently recognized,
and therefore still imperfectly known. Commencing
with the earliest organisms, the very dawn of life, in
the very lowest rocks, and passing onward and upward
through Eozoic, Palæozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic, to the
Psychozoic or present time, we again find first the lowest
forms, and then successively forms more and more complex
in structure, in the interaction of correlated parts
and in interaction with the environment, until we reach
the most complex internal and external relations, and
therefore the highest structure only in the present <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>
This series we will call the geological or <i>phylogenic</i> <span class="locked">series.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>
According to the evolution theory, the terms of
<i>this</i> series also are genetically connected. It is, therefore,
an evolution series. Furthermore, it is the most
fundamental of the three series, because it is the <i>cause</i>
of the other two. The Ontogenic series is like it because
it is a brief recapitulation, through heredity, as it were
from memory, of its main points. The Taxonomic series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
is like it because the <i>rate</i> of advance along different lines
was different in every degree, and therefore every stage
of the advance is still represented in a general way
among existing forms. Some of these points will be explained
more fully in future chapters, in connection with
the evidences of the truth of evolution.</p>

<p>It will be admitted, then, that we find <i>progressive
change</i> in organic forms throughout geological times.
This is the first point in the definition of evolution.</p>

<p>II. <b>Change according to Certain Laws.</b>&mdash;We have
shown continuously progressive change in organic forms
during the whole geologic history of the earth, similar
in a general way to that observed in embryonic development.
We wish now to show that the <i>laws of change</i>
are similar in the two cases. What, then, are the laws of
succession of organic forms in geologic times? I have
been accustomed to formulate them thus: <i>a.</i> The law of
differentiation; <i>b.</i> The law of progress of the whole; <i>c.</i>
The law of cyclical <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> We will take up these
and explain them successively, and then, afterward, show
that they are also the laws of embryonic development,
and therefore the laws of evolution.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <b>Law of Differentiation.</b>&mdash;It is a most significant
fact, to which attention was first strongly directed by
Louis Agassiz, that the earliest representatives of any
group, whether class, order, or family, were not what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
would now call typical representatives of that group;
but, on the contrary, they were, in a wonderful degree,
connecting links; that is, that along with their distinctive
classic, ordinal, or family characters they possessed
also other characters which connected them closely with
other classes, orders, or families, now widely distinct,
without connecting links or intermediate forms. For
example: The earliest vertebrates were fishes, but not
typical fishes. On the contrary, they were fishes so
closely connected by many characters with amphibian
reptiles, that we hardly know whether to call some of
them reptilian fishes, or fish-like reptiles. From these,
as from a common vertebrate stem, were afterward separated,
by slow changes from generation to generation, in
two directions, the typical fishes and the true reptiles.
So, also, to take another example, the first birds were far
different from typical birds as we now know them. They
were, on contrary, birds so reptilian in character, that
there is still some doubt whether bird-characters or reptilian
characters predominate in the mixture, and therefore
whether they ought to be called reptilian birds or
bird-like reptiles. From this common stem, the more
specialized modern reptiles branched off in one direction
and typical birds in another, and intermediate forms became
extinct; until <i>now</i>, the two classes stand widely
apart, without apparent genetic connection. This subject
will be more fully treated hereafter, and other examples
given. These two will be sufficient now to make
the idea clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Such early forms combining the characters of two or
more groups, now widely separated, were called by Agassiz
<i>connecting</i> types, <i>combining</i> types, <i>synthetic</i> types,
and sometimes <i>prophetic</i> types; by Dana, <i>comprehensive</i>
types; and by Huxley, <i>generalized</i> types. They are
most usually known now as <i>generalized</i> types, and their
widely-separated outcomes <i>specialized</i> types. Thus, in
general, we may say that the widely-separated groups of
the present day, when traced back in geological times,
approach one another more and more until they finally
unite to form common stems, and these in their turn
unite to form a common trunk. From such a common
trunk, by successive branching and rebranching, each
branch taking a different direction, and all growing wider
and wider apart (differentiation), have been gradually
generated all the diversified forms which we see at the
present day. The last leafy ramifications&mdash;flower-bearing
and fruit-bearing&mdash;of this tree of life, are the fauna
and flora of the present epoch. The law might be called
a law of ramification, of specialization of the parts, and
diversification of the whole.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <b>Law of Progress of the Whole.</b>&mdash;Many imagine
that progress is the one law of evolution; in fact, that
evolution and progress are coextensive and convertible
terms. They imagine that in evolution the movement
must be upward and onward in all parts; that degeneration
is the opposite of evolution. This is far from the
truth. There is, doubtless, in evolution, progress to
higher and higher planes; but not along every line, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
in every part; for this would be contrary to the law of
differentiation. It is only progress of the whole organic
kingdom in its entirety. We can best make this clear
by an illustration. A growing tree branches and again
branches <i>in all directions</i>, some branches going upward
some sidewise, and some downward&mdash;anywhere, everywhere,
for light and air; but the whole tree grows ever
taller in its higher branches, larger in the circumference
of its outstretching arms, and more diversified in structure.
Even so the tree of life, by the law of differentiation,
branches and rebranches continually in all directions&mdash;some
branches going upward to higher planes
(progress), some pushing horizontally; neither rising
nor sinking, but only going farther from the generalized
origin (specialization); some going downward (degeneration),
anywhere, everywhere, for an unoccupied
place in the economy of Nature, but the whole tree
grows ever higher in its highest parts, grander in its
proportions, and more complexly diversified in its
structure.</p>

<p>It may be well to pause here a moment to show how
this mistaken identification of evolution with progress
alone, without modification by the more fundamental
laws of differentiation, has given rise to misconceptions
in the popular and even in the scientific mind. The biologist
is continually met with the question, “Do you
mean to say that any one of the invertebrates, such, for
instance, as a spider, may eventually, in the course of
successive generations, become a vertebrate, or that a dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
or a monkey is on the highway to become a man?” By
no means. There is but one straight and narrow way to
the highest in evolution as in all else, and few there be
that have found it&mdash;in fact, probably two or three only
at every step. The animals mentioned above have diverged
from that way. In their ancestral history, they
have missed the golden opportunity, if they ever had
it. It is easy to go on in the way they have chosen,
but impossible to get back on the ascending trunk-line.
To compare again with the growing tree, only
one straight trunk-line leads upward to the terminal
bud. A branch once separated must grow its own way,
if it grow at all.</p>

<p>Of the same nature is the mistake of some extreme
evolutionists, such as Dr. Bastian and Professor Haeckel,
and of nearly all anti-evolutionists, viz., that of imagining
that the truth of evolution and that of spontaneous
generation must stand or fall together. On the contrary,
<i>if</i> life did <i>once</i> arise spontaneously from any lower
forces, physical or chemical, by natural process, <i>the conditions
necessary for so extraordinary a change could
hardly be expected to occur but once in the history of the
earth</i>. They are, therefore, <i>now</i>, not only unreproducible,
but unimaginable. Such golden opportunities do
not recur. Evolution goes only onward. Therefore, the
impossibility of the derivation of life from non-life <i>now</i>,
is no more an argument against such a derivation <i>once</i>,
than is the hopelessness of a worm ever becoming a vertebrate
<i>now</i>, an argument against the derivative origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of vertebrates. Doubtless if life were now extinguished
from the face of the earth, it could not again be rekindled
by any natural process known to us; but the same is
probably true of every step of evolution. If any class&mdash;for
example, mammals&mdash;were now destroyed, it could not
be re-formed from any other class now living. It would
be necessary to go back to the time and conditions of the
separation of this class from the reptilian stem. Therefore,
the falseness of the doctrine of <span class="locked">abiogenesis,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> so far
from being any argument against evolution, is exactly
what a true conception of evolution and knowledge of its
laws would lead us to expect.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <b>Law of Cyclical Movement.</b>&mdash;The movement of evolution
has ever been onward and upward, it is true, but
not at uniform rate in the whole, and especially in the
parts. On the contrary, it has plainly moved in successive
cycles. The tide of evolution rose ever higher and
higher, without ebb, but it nevertheless came in successive
waves, each higher than the preceding and overborne
by the succeeding. These successive cycles are the dynasties
or reigns of Agassiz, and ages of Dana; the reign
of mollusks, the reign of fishes, of reptiles, of mammals,
and finally of <i>man</i>. During the early Palæozoic times
(Cambrian and Silurian) there were no <span class="locked">vertebrates.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>
But never in the history of the earth were mollusks of
greater size, number, and variety of form than then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
They were truly the rulers of these early seas. In the
absence of competition of still higher animals, they had
things all their own way, and therefore grew into a great
monopoly of power. In the later Palæozoic (Devonian)
fishes were introduced. They increased rapidly in size,
number, and variety; and being of higher organization
they quickly usurped the empire of the seas, while the
mollusca dwindled in size and importance, and sought
safety in a less conspicuous position. In the Mesozoic
times, reptiles, introduced a little <span class="locked">earlier,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> finding congenial
conditions and an unoccupied place above, rapidly
increased in number, variety, and size, until sea and land
seem to have swarmed with them. Never before or since
have reptiles existed in such numbers, in such variety
of form, or assumed such huge proportions; nor have
they ever since been so highly organized as then. They
quickly became rulers in every realm of Nature&mdash;rulers of
the sea, swimming reptiles; rulers of the land, walking
reptiles; and rulers of the air, flying reptiles. In the unequal
contest, fishes therefore sought safety in subordination.
Meanwhile mammals were introduced in the Mesozoic,
but small in size, low in type (marsupials), and by
no means able to contest the empire with the great reptiles.
But in the Cenozoic (Tertiary) the conditions apparently
becoming favorable for their development, they
rapidly increased in number, size, variety, and grade of
organization, and quickly overpowered the great reptiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
which almost immediately sank into the subordinate position
in which we now find them, and thus found comparative
safety. Finally, in the Quaternary, appeared
man, contending doubtfully for a while, with the great
mammals, but soon (in Psychozoic) acquiring mastery
through superior intelligence. The huge and dangerous
mammals were destroyed and are still being destroyed;
the useful animals and plants were preserved and made
subservient to his wants; and all things on the face of
the earth are being readjusted to the requirements of his
rule. In all cases it will be observed that the rulers were
such because, by reason of strength, organization, and intelligence,
they were fittest to rule. There is always room
at the top. To illustrate again by a growing tree: This
successive culmination of higher and higher classes may
be compared to the flowering and fruiting of successively
higher and higher branches. Each uppermost branch,
under the genial heat and light of direct sunshine, received
in abundance by reason of position, grew rapidly,
flowered, and fruited; but quickly dwindled when overshadowed
by still higher branches, which, in their turn,
monopolized for a time the precious sunshine.</p>

<p>But observe, furthermore: when each ruling class declined
in importance, it did not perish, but continued in
a subordinate position. Thus, the whole organic kingdom
became not only higher and higher in its highest
forms, but also more and more complex in its structure
and in the interaction of its correlated parts. The whole
process and its result is roughly represented in the accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Above Three Laws Are Laws of Evolution.</span></h3>

<p>These three laws we have shown are distinctly recognizable
in the succession of organic forms in the geological
history of the earth. They are, therefore, undoubtedly
the <i>general laws of succession</i>. Are they also laws
of evolution? Are they also discoverable in embryonic
development, the type of evolution? They are, as we
now proceed to show:</p>

<p><b>Differentiation.</b>&mdash;In reproduction the new individual
appears: 1. As a <i>germ</i>-cell&mdash;a single microscopic living
cell. 2. Then, by growth and multiplication of cells, it
becomes an <i>egg</i>. This may be characterized as an aggregate
of <i>similar</i> cells, and therefore is not yet differentiated
into tissues and organs. In other words, it is not
yet visibly organized; for organization may be defined as
the possession of different parts, performing different
functions, and all co-operating for one given end, viz.,
the life and well-being of the organism. 3. Then commences
the really characteristic process of development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
viz., <i>differentiation</i> or diversification. The cells are at
first all alike in form and function, for all are globular
in form, and each performs all the functions necessary
for life. From this common point now commences development
in <i>different directions</i>, which may be compared
to a branching and rebranching, with more and
more complex results, according as the animal is higher
in the scale of organization and advances toward a state
of maturity. First, the cell-aggregate (egg) separates into
three distinct layers of cells, called ecto-blast, endo-blast,
and meso-blast. These by further differentiation form the
three fundamental groups of organs and functions, viz.,
the <i>nervous system</i>, the <i>nutritive system</i>, and the <i>blood
system</i>: the first presiding over the exchange of <i>force</i> or
influence, by action and reaction with the environment,
and between the different parts of the organism; the second
presiding over the exchange of <i>matter</i> with the environment,
by absorption and elimination; the third presiding
over exchanges of matter between different parts of
the organism. The first system of functions and organs
may be compared to a system of telegraphy, foreign and
domestic; the second to foreign commerce; the third to
an internal carrying-trade. Following out any one of
these groups in higher animals, say the nervous system, it
quickly differentiates again into two sub-systems, viz., cerebro-spinal
and ganglionic, each having its own distinctive
functions, which we can not stop to explain. Then the
cerebro-spinal again differentiates into voluntary and reflex
systems. All of these have meanwhile separated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
sensory and motor centers and fibers. Then, taking only
the sensory fibers, these again are differentiated into five
special senses, each having a wholly different function.
Then, finally, taking any one of these, say the <i>sense of
touch</i> or feeling, this again is differentiated into many
kinds of fibers, each responding to a different impression,
some to heat, others to cold, still others to pressure, etc.
We have taken the nervous system; but the same differentiation
and redifferentiation takes place in all other
systems, and is carried to higher and higher points according
to the position in the scale of the animal which
is to be formed.</p>

<p>Or, to vary the mode of presentation a little, the cells
of the original aggregate, commencing all alike, immediately
begin to take on different forms, in order to perform
different functions. Some cells take on a certain
form and aggregate themselves to form a peculiar tissue
which we call muscle, and which does nothing else, can
do nothing else, than contract under stimulus. Another
group of cells take on another peculiar form and aggregate
themselves to form another and very different tissue,
viz., nervous tissue, which does nothing and can do
nothing but carry influence back and forth between the
great external world and the little world of consciousness
within. Still another group of cells take still another
form and aggregate to form still another tissue, viz., the
<i>epithelial</i>, whose only function is to absorb nutritive and
eliminate waste matters. Thus, by differentiation of
form and limitation of function, or division of labor, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
different parts of the organism are bound more and more
closely together by mutual dependence, and the whole
becomes more and more distinctly individuated, and
separation of parts becomes more and more a mutilation,
and finally becomes impossible without death. This process,
as already said, reaches its highest point only in the
later stages of development of the highest animals.</p>

<p><b>Progress.</b>&mdash;The <i>law of progress</i> is, of course, admitted
to be a law of ontogeny; but observe here, also, it is true
only of the whole and not necessarily of all the parts, <i>except
from the point of view of the whole</i>. Thus, for example,
starting all from a common form or generalized
type, some cells <i>advance</i> to the dignity of brain-cells,
whose function is somehow connected with the generation
or at least the manifestation of thought, will, and
emotion; other cells <i>descend</i> to the position of kidney-cells,
whose sole function is the excretion of urine. But
here, also, the highest cells are successively higher, and
the whole aggregate is successively nobler and more complex.
It is again a branching and rebranching, in every
direction, some going upward, some downward, some
horizontally, anywhere, everywhere, to increase the complexity
of relations internal and external, and therefore
to elevate the plane of the whole.</p>

<p><b>Cyclical Movement.</b>&mdash;Lastly, the law of cyclical movement
is also a law of ontogeny and therefore of evolution.
This law, however, is less fundamental than the other
two, and is, therefore, less conspicuous in the ontogenic
than in the phylogenic series. It is conspicuous only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the later stages of ontogeny, and in other higher kinds
of evolution, such as social evolution. For example, in
the ontogenic development of the body and mind from
childhood to manhood we have plainly successive culminations
and declines of higher and higher functions. In
bodily development we have culminating first the <i>nutritive</i>
functions, then the <i>reproductive</i> and <i>muscular</i>, and
last the <i>cerebral</i>. In mental development we have culmination
first of the receptive and retentive faculties in
childhood, then of imaginative and æsthetic faculties in
youth and young manhood; then of the reflective and
elaborative faculties&mdash;the faculties of productive work in
mature manhood; and, finally, the moral and religious
sentiments in old age. The first gathers and stores materials;
the second vivifies and makes them plastic
building materials; the third uses them in actual constructive
work&mdash;in building the temple of science and
philosophy; and the fourth dedicates that temple only
to noblest purposes.</p>

<p>Observe here, also, that when each group of faculties
culminates and declines, it does not perish, but only becomes
subordinate to the next higher dominant group,
and the whole psychical organism becomes not only
higher and higher in its highest parts, but also more and
more complex in its structure and in the interaction of
its correlated parts.</p>

<p>Observe, again, the necessity laid upon us by this law&mdash;the
necessity of continued evolution to the end. Childhood,
beautiful childhood, can not remain&mdash;it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
quickly pass. If, with the decline of its characteristic
faculties, the next higher group characteristic of youth
do not increase and become dominant, then the glory of
life is already past and deterioration begins. Have we
not all seen sad examples of this? Youth, glorious
youth, must also pass. If the next higher group of reflective
and elaborative faculties do not arise and dominate,
then progressive deterioration of character commences
here&mdash;thenceforward the whole nature becomes
coarse, as we so often see in young men, or else shrivels
and withers, as we so often see in young women. Finally,
manhood, strong and self-relying manhood, must also
pass. If the moral and religious sentiments have not
been slowly growing and gathering strength all along,
and do not now assert their dominance over the whole
man, then commences the final and saddest decline of
all, and old age becomes the pitiable thing we so often
see it. But, if the evolution have been normal throughout;
if the highest moral and religious nature have been
gathering strength through all, and now dominates all,
then the psychic evolution rises to the end&mdash;then the
course of life is like a wave rising and cresting only at
the moment of its dissolution, or, like the course of the
sun, if not brightest at least most glorious in its setting.
And thus&mdash;may we not hope?&mdash;the glories of the close of
a well-spent life become the pledge and harbinger of an
eternal to-morrow?</p>

<p>We have thus far illustrated the three laws of succession
of organic forms by ontogeny, because this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
type of evolution; but they may be illustrated also by
other forms of evolution. Next to the development of
the individual, undoubtedly the <i>progress of society</i> furnishes
the best illustration of these laws.</p>

<p>Commencing with a condition in which each individual
performs all necessary social functions, but very
imperfectly; in which each individual is his own shoemaker
and tailor, and house-builder and farmer, and
therefore all persons are socially alike; as society advances,
the constituent members begin to diverge, some
taking on one social function and some another, until in
the highest stages of social organization this diversification
or division and subdivision of labor reaches its highest
point, and each member of the aggregate can do perfectly
but one thing. Thus, the social organism becomes
more and more strongly bound together by mutual dependence,
and separation becomes mutilation. I do not
mean to say that this extreme is desirable, but only that
an approach to this is <i>a</i> natural law of social development.
<i>Is not this the law of differentiation?</i></p>

<p>So also <i>progress</i> is here, as in other forms of evolution&mdash;a
<i>progress of the whole</i>, but not necessarily of
every part. Some members of the social aggregate advance
<i>upward</i> to the dignity of statesmen, philosophers,
and poets; some advance <i>downward</i> to the position of
scavengers and <span class="locked">sewer-cleansers.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> But the highest members
are progressively higher, and the whole aggregate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
progressively grander and more complex in structure and
functions.</p>

<p>So, again, the <i>law of cyclical movement</i> is equally
conspicuous here. Society everywhere advances, not uniformly,
but by successive waves, each higher than the
last; each urged by a new and higher social force,
and embodying a new and higher phase of civilization.
Again: as each phase declines, its characteristic social
force is not lost, but becomes incorporated into the next
higher phase as a subordinate principle, and thus the
social organism as a whole becomes not only higher and
higher, but also more and more complex in the mutual
relations of its interacting social forces.</p>

<p>Let us not be misunderstood, however. There is undoubtedly
in social evolution something more and higher
than we have described, but which does not concern us
here, except to guard against misconstruction. There
is in society a <i>voluntary progress</i> wholly different from
the evolution we have been describing. In <i>true</i> or material
evolution natural law works for the betterment of
the whole utterly regardless of the elevation of the individual,
and the individual contributes to the advance of
the whole quite unconsciously while striving only for his
own betterment. This unconscious evolution by natural
law inherited from the animal kingdom is conspicuous
enough in society, especially in its early stages, but we
would make a great mistake if we imagined, as some do,
that this is all. Besides the unconscious evolution by
natural laws, <i>inherited from below</i>, there is a higher evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<i>inherited from above</i>, indissolubly connected with
man’s spiritual nature&mdash;a conscious, voluntary striving
of the best members of the social aggregate for the betterment
of the whole&mdash;a conscious, voluntary striving
both of the individual and of society toward a recognized
<i>ideal</i>. In the one kind of evolution the fittest
are those most in harmony with the environment, and
which therefore always survive; in the other, the fittest
are those most in harmony with the ideal, and which
often do not survive. The laws of this free voluntary
progress are little understood. They are of supreme
importance, but do not specially concern us here. We
will speak of it again in another chapter.</p>

<p>The three laws above mentioned might be illustrated
equally well by all other forms of evolution. We have
selected only those which are most familiar. They may,
therefore, be truly called the laws of evolution. We
have shown that they are the laws of succession of organic
forms.</p>

<p><b>III. Change by Means of Resident Forces.</b>&mdash;Thus far
in our argument I suppose that most well-informed men
will raise no objection. It will be admitted, I think,
even by those most bitterly opposed to the theory of evolution,
that there has been throughout the whole geological
history of the earth an onward movement of the organic
kingdom to higher and higher levels. It will be
admitted, also, that there is a grand and most significant
resemblance between the course of development of the
organic kingdom and the course of embryonic development&mdash;between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the laws of succession of organic forms
and the laws of ontogenic evolution. But there is another
essential element in ontogenic evolution. It is
that the <i>forces</i> or causes of evolution are <i>natural</i>; that
they reside in the thing developing and in the reacting
environment. This we know is true of embryonic development;
is it true also of the geologic succession of organic
forms? It is true of ontogeny; is it true also of
phylogeny? If not, then only by a metaphor can we call
the process of change in the organic kingdom throughout
geological history an evolution. This is the point of
discussion, and not only of discussion, but, alas! of
heated and even angry dispute. The field of discussion
is thus narrowed to this third point only.</p>

<p>Before stating the two opposite views of the cause of
evolution, it is necessary to remind the reader that when
the evolutionist speaks of the forces that determine progressive
changes in organic forms as <i>resident</i> or <i>inherent</i>,
all that he means, or ought to mean, is that they are
resident in the same sense as all natural forces are resident;
in the same sense that the vital forces of the embryo
are resident in the embryo, or that the forces of the
development of the solar system according to the nebular
or any other cosmogonic hypotheses are resident in that
system. In other words, they mean only that they are
<i>natural</i>, not supernatural. This does not, of course,
touch that deeper, that deepest of all questions, viz.,
the essential <i>nature and origin of natural forces</i>; how
far they are independent and self-existent, and how far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
they are only modes of divine energy. This is a question
of philosophy, not of science. This question is briefly
discussed in another place (<a href="#CHAPTER_III_III">Part III, Chap. III</a>); it does
not immediately concern us here.</p>

<p><b>The Two Views briefly Contrasted.</b>&mdash;As already stated,
all will admit a grand resemblance between the stages of
embryonic development and those of the development of
the organic kingdom. This was first brought out clearly
by Louis Agassiz, and is, in fact, the greatest result of
his life-work. All admit, also, that the embryonic development
is a natural process. Is the development of
the organic kingdom also a natural process? All biologists
of the present day contend that it is; all the old-school
naturalists, with Agassiz at their head, and all
anti-evolutionists of every school, contend that it is not.
We take Agassiz as the type of this school, because he
has most fully elaborated and most distinctly formulated
this view. As formulated by him, it has stood in the
minds of many as an alternative and substitute for evolution.</p>

<p>According to the evolutionists, all organic forms,
whether species, genera, families, orders, classes, etc., are
variable, and, if external conditions favor, these variations
accumulate in one direction and gradually produce
new forms, the intermediate links being usually destroyed
or dying out. According to Agassiz, the higher groups,
such as genera, families, orders, etc., are indeed variable
by the introduction of new species, but species are
the ultimate elements of classification, and, like the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
elements of chemistry, are unchangeable; and,
therefore, the speculations of the evolutionist concerning
the transmutation of species are as vain as were the speculations
of the alchemists concerning the transmutation
of metals&mdash;that the origin of man, for example, from
any lower species is as impossible as the origin of gold
from any baser metal. Both sides admit frequent change
of species during geological history, but one regards the
change as a change by gradual <i>transmutation</i> of one
species <i>into</i> another through successive generations and
by <i>natural</i> process, the other as change by <i>substitution</i>
of one species <i>for</i> another by direct supernatural <i>creative
act</i>. Both admit the gradual development of the organic
kingdom as a whole through stages similar to those of
embryonic development; but the one regards the whole
process as natural, and therefore strictly comparable to
embryonic development, the other as requiring frequent
special interference of creative energy, and therefore
comparable rather to the development of a building under
the hand and according to the preconceived plan of
an architect&mdash;a plan, in this case, conceived in eternity
and carried out consistently through infinite time. It is
seen that the essential point of difference is this: The
one asserts the variability of species (if conditions favor,
and time enough is given) without limit; the other asserts
the permanency of specific forms, or their variability
only within narrow limits. The one asserts the origin
of species by “<i>descent with modifications</i>”; the other,
the origin of species by “<i>special act of creation</i>.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
one asserts the law of continuity (i.&nbsp;e., that each stage is
the natural outcome of the immediately preceding stage)
in this, as in every other department of Nature; the
other asserts that the law of continuity (i.&nbsp;e., of cause
and effect) does not hold in this department; that the
links of the chain of changes are discontinuous, the connection
between them being intellectual, not physical.</p>

<p>So much for sharp contrasting characterization of the
two views, necessary for clear understanding of much
that follows. We will have to give them more fully
hereafter when we take up the evidences of evolution in
<a href="#PART_II">Part II</a>.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_I_II" id="CHAPTER_I_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF LOUIS AGASSIZ TO THE THEORY OF
EVOLUTION.</span></h2>

<p>In order to clear up the conception of evolution, it is
necessary to give a brief history of the idea, and especially
to explain the relation of Louis Agassiz to that
theory. This is the more necessary, because there is a
deep and wide-spread misunderstanding on this subject,
and thus scant justice has been done our great naturalist,
especially by the English and Germans; and also because
this relation is an admirable illustration of an important
principle in scientific philosophy.</p>

<p>Like all great ideas, we find the first germs of this in
Greek philosophy, in the cosmic speculations of Thales
and Pythagoras. Next (about 100 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) we find it more
clearly expressed by the Roman thinker, Lucretius, in
his great philosophic poem entitled “De Rerum Natura.”
After a dormancy of nearly eighteen centuries it next
emerges with still more clearness in the theological speculations
of Swedenborg and the philosophical speculations
of Kant. All these we pass over with bare mention, because
these thinkers approached the subject from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
philosophic rather than the scientific side&mdash;in the metaphysical
rather than the scientific spirit.</p>

<p>The first serious attempt at scientific presentation of
the subject was by the celebrated naturalist, Lamarck, in
a work entitled “Philosophie Zoölogique,” published in
1809. It is not necessary, in this rapid sketch, to give a
full account of Lamarck’s views. Suffice it to say that
the essential idea of evolution, viz., the indefinite variability
and the derivative origin of species, was insisted
on with great learning and skill, and illustrated by many
examples. With Lamarck, the factors of evolution or
causes of change of organic forms were&mdash;1. Modification
of organs in function and therefore in structure, by a
changing environment&mdash;external factor; and, 2. Modification
of organs by <i>use</i> and <i>disuse</i>&mdash;internal factor. In
both cases the modifications are inherited and increased
from generation to generation, without limit. This second
factor seems to have taken, in the mind of Lamarck,
the somewhat vague and transcendental form of aspiration
or upward striving of the animal toward higher
conditions. These are acknowledged to-day as true factors
of evolution, but the distinctively Darwinian factor,
viz., “divergent variation and natural selection,” was
not then thought of. The publication of Lamarck’s
views produced a powerful impression, but only for
a little while. Pierced by the shafts of ridicule shot
by nimble wits of Paris, and crushed beneath the
heavy weight of the authority of Cuvier, the greatest
naturalist and comparative anatomist of that or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of any time, it fell almost still-born. I believe it was
best that it should thus perish. Its birth was premature;
it was not fit to live. The world was not yet prepared
for a true scientific theory. Nevertheless, the
work was not without its effect upon some of the most
advanced thinkers of that time; upon Saint-Hilaire and
Comte in France, and upon Goethe and Oken in Germany.
It was good seed sown and destined to spring up
and bear fruit in suitable environment; but not yet.</p>

<p>The next attempt worthy of attention in this rapid
sketch is that of Robert Chambers, in a little volume entitled
“Vestiges of a Natural History of Creation,” published
in 1844. It was essentially a reproduction of
Lamarck’s views in a more popular form. It was not a
truly scientific work nor written by a scientific man. It
was rather an appeal from the too technical court of science
to the supposed wider and more unprejudiced court
of popular intelligence. It was therefore far more eloquent
than accurate; far more specious than profound.
It was, indeed, full of false facts and inconsequent reasonings.
Nevertheless, it produced a very strong impression
on the thinking, popular mind. But <i>it</i> also quickly
fell, pierced by keen shafts of ridicule, and crushed beneath
the heavy weight of the authority of all the most
prominent naturalists of that time, with Agassiz at their
head. The question for the time seemed closed. I believe,
again, it was best so, for the time was not yet fully
ripe.</p>

<p>I know full well that many think with Haeckel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
biology was kept back half a century by the baneful authority
of Cuvier and Agassiz; but I can not think so.
The hypothesis was contrary to the facts of science <i>as
then known and understood</i>. It was conceived in the
spirit of baseless speculation, rather than of cautious
induction; of skillful elaboration rather than of earnest
truth-seeking. Its general acceptance would have debauched
the true spirit of science. I repeat it: the time
was not yet ripe for a scientific theory. The ground
must first be cleared and a solid foundation built; an insuperable
<i>obstacle</i> to hearty rational acceptance must
first be removed, and an inductive <i>basis</i> must be laid.</p>

<p><b>The Obstacle removed.</b>&mdash;The obstacle in the way of
the acceptance of the derivative origin of species was the
then prevalent <i>notion concerning the nature of life</i>. We
must briefly sketch the change which has taken place in
the last forty years in our ideas on this subject.</p>

<p>Until about forty years ago, the different forces of
Nature, such as gravity, electricity, magnetism, light,
heat, chemical affinity, etc., were supposed to be entirely
distinct. The realm of Nature was divided up into a
number of distinct and independent principalities, each
subject to its own sovereign force and ruled by its own
petty laws. About that time it began to be evident, and
is now universally acknowledged, that all these forces are
but different <i>forms</i> of one, universal, omnipresent energy,
and are transmutable unto one another back and forth
without loss. This is the doctrine of correlation of
forces and conservation of energy, one of the grandest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
ideas of modern times. But <i>one</i> force seemed still to be
an exception. Life-force was still believed to be a peculiar,
mysterious principle or entity, standing above
other forces and subordinating them; not correlated
with, not transmutable unto, nor derivable from, other
and lower forces, and therefore in some sense supernatural.
Now, if this be true of living <i>forces</i>, it is perfectly
natural, yea, almost necessary, to believe that living
<i>forms</i> are wholly different from other forms in their
origin. New forms of dead matter may be derived, but
new living forms are <i>underived</i>. Other new forms come
by natural process, new organic forms by supernatural
process. The conclusion was almost unavoidable. But
soon vital force also yielded to the general law of correlation
of natural forces. Vital forces are also transmutable
into and derivable from physical and chemical forces.
Sun-force, falling on the green leaves of plants, is absorbed
and converted into vital force, disappears as <i>light</i>
to reappear as <i>life</i>. The amount of life-force generated
is measured by the amount of light extinguished. The
same is true of animal life. As in the steam-engine the
locomotive energy is derived from the fuel consumed and
measured by its amount, so in the animal body, the animal
heat and animal force are derived from and measured
by the food and tissue consumed by combustion. Thus,
vital force may be regarded as so much force withdrawn
from the general fund of chemical and physical forces, to
be again refunded without loss at death. This obstacle
is, therefore, now removed. If vital force falls in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
same category as other natural forces, there is no reason
why living forms should not fall into the same category
in this regard as other natural forms. If new forms of
dead matter are derived from old forms by modification,
according to <i>physical</i> laws, there is no reason why new
living forms should not also be derived from old forms
by modification according to <i>physiological</i> laws. Thus,
at last, the obstacle was removed&mdash;the ground was
cleared.</p>

<p><b>The Basis laid.</b>&mdash;But Science is not content with removal
of <i>a priori</i> objections. She must also have positive
proofs. The ground must not only be cleared, but a
true inductive basis of facts, and especially of laws and
methods, must be laid. <i>This was the life-work of Agassiz.</i>
Yes, as strange as it may seem to some, it is nevertheless
true that the whole inductive basis, upon which
was afterward built the modern theory of evolution, was
laid by Agassiz, although he himself persistently refused
to build upon it any really scientific superstructure. It
is plain, then, that all attempts at building previous to
Agassiz’s work must, of necessity, have resulted in an
unsubstantial structure&mdash;an edifice built on sand, which
could not and ought not to stand. I must stop here in
order to explain somewhat fully this important point,
and thus to give due credit to the work of Agassiz.</p>

<p>The title of any scientist to greatness must be determined,
not so much by the multitude of new facts he has
discovered as by the new laws he has established, and
especially by the new methods he has inaugurated or perfected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Now, I think it can be shown that to Agassiz,
more than to any other man, is due the credit of having
<i>established the laws of succession of living forms</i> in the
geological history of the earth&mdash;laws upon which must
rest any true theory of evolution. Also, that to him,
more than to any other man, is due the credit of having
<i>perfected the method</i> (method of comparison) by the use
of which alone biological science has advanced so rapidly
in modern times. This is high praise. I wish to justify
it. I begin with the method.</p>

<p>Scientific methods bear the same relation to <i>intellectual
progress</i> that tools, instruments, machines, mechanical
contrivances of all sorts, bear to <i>material progress</i>.
They are intellectual <i>contrivances</i>&mdash;indirect ways of accomplishing
results far too hard for bare-handed, unaided
intellectual strength. As the civilized man has little or
no advantage over the savage in bare-handed strength of
muscle, and the enormous superiority of the latter in
accomplishing material results is due wholly to the use
of mechanical contrivances or machines; even so, in the
higher sphere of intellect, the scientist makes no pretension
to the possession of greater unaided intellectual
strength than belongs to the uncultured man, or even
perhaps to the savage. The amazing intellectual results
achieved by science are due wholly to the use of intellectual
contrivances or scientific methods. As in the lower
sphere of material progress the greatest benefactors of
the race are the inventors or perfecters of new mechanical
contrivances or <i>machines</i>, so also in the higher sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of intellectual progress the greatest benefactors of the
race are the inventors or perfecters of new intellectual
contrivances or <i>methods of research</i>.</p>

<p>To illustrate the power of methods, and the necessity
of their use, take the case of the <i>method of notation</i>, so
characteristic of mathematics, and take it even in its
simplest and most familiar form: Nine numeral figures,
having each a value of its own, and another dependent
upon its position; a few letters, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
connected by symbols, + and-and =: that is all. And
yet, by the use of this simple contrivance, the dullest
school-boy accomplishes intellectual results which would
defy the utmost efforts of the unaided strength of the
greatest genius. And this is only the simplest tool-form
of this method. Think of the results accomplished by
the use of the more complex machinery of the higher
mathematics!</p>

<p>Take next the method of experiment so characteristic
of physics and chemistry. The phenomena of the external
world are far too complex and far too much affected by
disturbing forces and modifying conditions to be understood
at once by bare, unaided intellectual insight. They
must first be simplified. The physicist, therefore, contrives
artificial phenomena under ideal conditions. He
removes one complicating condition after another, one
disturbing cause and then another, watching meanwhile
the result, until finally the necessary condition and the
true cause are discovered. On this method rests the
whole fabric of the physical and chemical sciences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
But when we rise still higher, viz., into the plane of
life, the phenomena of Nature become still more complex
and difficult to understand directly; and yet just
here, where we are the most powerless without some
method, our method of experiment almost wholly <i>fails
us</i>. The phenomena of life are not only far more complex
than those of dead matter, but the conditions of life
are so nicely adjusted, the equilibrium of forces so delicately
balanced, that, when we attempt to introduce our
clumsy hands in the way of experiment, we are in danger
of overthrowing the equilibrium, of destroying the conditions
of the experiment, viz., life; and then the whole
problem falls immediately into the domain of chemistry.
What shall we do? In this dilemma we find that Nature
herself has already prepared for us, ready to hand,
an elaborate series of simplified conditions equivalent to
experiments. The phenomena of life are, indeed, far too
complex to be at once understood&mdash;the problem of life
too hard to be solved&mdash;in the higher animals; but, as we
go down the animal scale, complicating conditions are
removed one by one, the phenomena of life become simpler
and simpler, until in the lowest microscopic cell or
spherule of living protoplasm we finally reach the simplest
possible expression of life. The equation of life is
reduced to its simplest terms, and now, if ever, we begin
to understand the true value of the unknown quantity.
This is the natural history series, or <i>Taxonomic</i> series,
already spoken of on <a href="#Page_10">page&nbsp;10</a>. Again, Nature has prepared,
and is now preparing daily before our eyes, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
series of gradually simplified conditions. Commencing
with the mature condition of one of the higher
animals&mdash;for example, man&mdash;and going backward along
the line of individual history through the stages of infant
embryo, egg and germ, we find again the phenomena
of life becoming simpler and simpler, until we again
reach the simplest conceivable condition in the single
microscopic cell or spherule of living protoplasm. This,
as already explained, is the embryonic or <i>Ontogenic</i> series.
Again, that there be no excuse for man’s ignorance
of the laws of life, Nature has prepared still another
series; and this the grandest of all, for it is the cause of
both the others. Commencing with the plants and animals
of the present epoch, and going back along the
track of geological times, through Cenozoic, Mesozoic,
Palæozoic, Eozoic, to the very dawn of life&mdash;the first
syllable of recorded time&mdash;and we find again a series of
organic forms growing simpler and simpler, until, if
we could find the very first, we would undoubtedly
again reach the simplest condition in the lowest conceivable
forms of life. This, as we have already seen,
is the geologic or evolution, or <i>Phylogenic</i> series. We
have already explained these three series, only in this
connection it suits our purpose to take the terms backward.</p>

<p>Now, it is by <i>comparison</i> of the terms of each of these
series going up and down, and watching the first appearance,
the growth, and the perfecting of tissues, organs,
functions, and by the comparison of the three series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
with one another term by term&mdash;I say it is wholly by
comparison of this kind that biology has in recent times
become a true inductive science. This is the “<i>method
of comparison</i>.” It is the great method of research in
all those departments which can not be readily managed
by the method of experiment. It has already regenerated
biology, and is now applied with like success in sociology
under the name of <i>historic method</i>. Yes; anatomy became
scientific only through comparative anatomy, physiology
through comparative physiology, and embryology
through comparative embryology. May we not add, sociology
will become truly scientific only through comparative
sociology, and psychology through comparative psychology?</p>

<p>Now, while it is true that this method, like all other
methods, has been used, from the earliest dawn of
thought, in a loose and imperfect way, yet it is only in
very recent times that it has been organized, systematized,
perfected, as a true scientific method, as a great
instrument of research; and the prodigious recent advance
of biology is due wholly to this cause. Now,
among the great leaders of this modern movement, Agassiz
undoubtedly stands in the very first rank. I must
try to make this point plain, for it is by no means generally
understood.</p>

<p>Cuvier is acknowledged to be the great founder of
comparative anatomy. He it was that first perfected the
method of comparison, but comparison only in one series&mdash;the
<i>Taxonomic</i>. Von Baer and Agassiz added to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
comparison in the ontogenic series also, and comparison
of these two series with each other, and therefore the
application of embryology to the classification of animals.
If Von Baer was the first announcer, Agassiz was the
first great practical worker by this method. Last and
most important of all, in its relation to evolution, Agassiz
added <i>comparison in the geologic or phylogenic series</i>.
The one grand idea underlying Agassiz’s whole life-work
was the essential identity of the three series, and therefore
the light which they must shed on one another.
The two guiding and animating principles of his scientific
work were&mdash;1. That the embryonic development of
one of the higher representatives of any group repeated
in a general way the terms of the Taxonomic series in
the same group, and therefore that embryology furnished
the key to a true classification; and, 2. That the succession
of forms and structure in geological times in any
group is similar to the succession of forms and structure
in the development of the individual in the same
group, and thus that embryology furnishes also the key
to geological succession. In other words, during his
whole life, Agassiz insisted that the laws of embryonic
development (ontogeny) are also the laws of geological
succession (phylogeny). Surely this is the foundation,
the only solid foundation, of a true theory of evolution.
It is true that Agassiz, holding as he did the doctrine
of permanency of specific types, and therefore rejecting
the doctrine of the derivative origin of species, did not
admit the causal or natural relation of phylogenic succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to embryonic succession and taxonomic order as we
now believe it&mdash;it is true that for him the relation between
the three series was an intellectual not a physical
one&mdash;consisted in the preordained plans of the Creator,
and not in any genetic connection or inherited property;
but evidently the first and greatest step was the discovery
of the relation itself, however accounted for. The rest
was sure to follow.</p>

<p>But more. Not only did Agassiz establish the essential
identity of the geologic and embryonic succession,
the general similarity of the two series, phylogenic and
ontogenic, but he also announced and enforced all the
formal laws of geologic succession (i.&nbsp;e., of evolution), as
we now know them. These, as already stated and illustrated,
are the law of differentiation, the law of progress
of the whole, and the law of cyclical movement, although
he did not formulate them in these words. No
true inductive evidence of evolution was possible without
the knowledge of these laws, and for this knowledge we
are mainly indebted to Agassiz. He well knew also that
they were the laws of embryonic development and therefore
of evolution; but he avoided the word evolution, as
implying the derivative origin of species, and used instead
the word <i>development</i>, though it is hard to see in
what the words differ. Thus, it is evident that Agassiz
laid the whole foundation of evolution, solid and broad,
but refused to build any scientific structure on it; he refused
to recognize the legitimate, the scientifically necessary
outcome of his own work. Nevertheless, without his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
work a scientific theory of evolution would have been
impossible. Without Agassiz (or his equivalent), there
would have been no Darwin.</p>

<p>There is something to us supremely grand in this refusal
of Agassiz to accept the theory of evolution. The
opportunity to become the leader of modern thought,
the foremost man of the century, was in his hands, and
he refused, because his religious, or, perhaps better, his
philosophic intuitions, forbade. To Agassiz, and, indeed,
to all men of that time, to many, alas! even now,
evolution is materialism. But materialism is Atheism.
Will some one say, the genuine Truth-seeker follows
where she seems to lead <i>whatever be the consequences</i>?
Yes; whatever be the consequences to one’s self, to one’s
opinions, prejudices, theories, philosophies, but not to
<i>still more certain truth</i>. Now, to Agassiz, as to all genuine
thinkers, the existence of God, like our own existence,
is more certain than any scientific theory, than anything
can possibly be made by proof. From his standpoint,
therefore, he was right in rejecting evolution as
conflicting with still more certain truth. The mistake
which he made was in imagining that there was any such
conflict at all. But this was the universal mistake of the
age. A lesser man would have seen less clearly the higher
truth and accepted the lower. A greater man would
have risen above the age, and seen that there was no
conflict, and so accepted both. All thinking men are
coming to this conclusion now, but none had done so
then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Now, then, at last, the obstacle of supernaturalism in
the realm of Nature having been removed by the establishment
of the doctrine of correlation of natural forces,
and the extension of this doctrine to embrace also life-force;
and now also a broad and firm basis of carefully-observed
facts and well-established laws of succession of
organic forms having been laid by Agassiz, when again,
for the third time, the doctrine of origin of species “by
derivation with modifications” was brought forward by
Darwin in a far more perfect form, with more abundant
illustrative materials, and with a new and most potent
factor of modification&mdash;viz., divergent variations and
natural selection&mdash;it found the scientific world already
fully prepared, and anxiously waiting. I say <i>anxiously</i>
waiting&mdash;for the supposed supernatural origin of species
had been the one exception to the otherwise universal
law of cause and effect, or the law of continuity. It
was therefore in open contradiction to the whole drift
of scientific thought for five hundred years. Is it any
wonder, then, that the derivative origin of species was
welcomed with joy by the scientific world? For five
hundred years, scientific thought, like a rising tide
which knows no ebb, had tended thitherward with ever-increasing
pressure, but kept back by the one supposed
fact of the supernatural origin of species. Darwin lifted
the gate, and the in-rushing tide flooded the whole domain
of thought.</p>

<p>What, then, is the place of Agassiz in biological science?
What is the relation of Agassiz to Darwin&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Agassizian development to Darwinian evolution? I answer,
it is the relation of formal science to physical or
causal science. Agassiz advanced biology to the <i>formal</i>
stage; Darwin carried it forward, to some extent at
least, to the <i>physical</i> stage. All true inductive sciences
in their complete development pass through these two
stages. Science in the one stage treats of the <i>laws</i> of
phenomena; in the other, of the <i>causes</i> or explanation of
these laws. The former must precede the latter, and
form its foundation; the latter must follow the former,
and constitute its completion. The change from the one
to the other is always attended with prodigious impulse
to science.</p>

<p>To illustrate: Until Kepler, astronomy was little more
than an accumulation of disconnected facts concerning
celestial motions&mdash;abundant materials, but no science;
piles of brick and stone, but no building. Kepler reduced
this chaos to beautiful order and musical harmony
by the discovery of the three great laws which bear his
name, and therefore he has been justly called the legislator
of the heavens&mdash;<i>the lawgiver of space</i>. But, had
he been asked the <i>cause</i> of these beautiful laws, he could
only have answered, “The <i>first cause</i>&mdash;the direct will
of the Deity.” A good answer and a true, but not scientific;
because it places the question beyond the domain
of science, which deals only with second or physical
causes. But Newton comes forward and gives a <i>physical
cause</i>. He shows that all these beautiful laws are the
necessary result of gravitation; and thus astronomy becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
a physical science. So, until Agassiz, the facts of
geological succession of organic forms were in a state of
lawless confusion. Agassiz by establishing the three great
laws of succession, which ought to bear his name, reduced
this chaos to order and beauty; and, therefore, he
might justly be called the legislator of geological history&mdash;the
<i>lawgiver of time</i>. But, when asked the cause of
these laws, he could only answer, and did indeed answer,
“The plans of the Creator.” A noble answer and
true, but not scientific. Darwin now comes forward and
gives, partly at least, the cause of these laws. He shows
that all these beautiful laws are explained by the doctrine
of “origin of species by derivation with modifications”;
that these laws are not ultimate, but derivative
from more fundamental laws of life; and thus biology is
advanced one step, at least, toward the causal stage.
Newton and Darwin substituted second causes for first
cause&mdash;natural for supernatural. They each in his own
department broke the bonds of supernaturalism in the
domain of Nature.</p>

<p>One more important reflection: There are two, and
only two, fundamental conditions of material existence&mdash;<i>space</i>
and <i>time</i>. There are, therefore, two, and only two,
cosmoses&mdash;space-cosmos and time-cosmos. These have
been redeemed from confusion and reduced to law and
order and beauty&mdash;changed from chaos to cosmos&mdash;by
science. For this result we are chiefly indebted, in the
one case, to Kepler and Newton; in the other, to Agassiz
and Darwin. The universal law, in the one cosmos, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the <i>law of gravitation</i>; in the other, the <i>law of evolution</i>.
Traced by analysis to its deepest roots of philosophic
truth, the one law may be called the divine mode of sustentation;
the other, the divine process of creation.</p>

<p>Or again: we have all heard of the “music of the
spheres”&mdash;a beautiful and significant name used by the
old thinkers for the divine order of the universe&mdash;a
music heard not by human ear, but only by the attentive
human spirit. Harmonic relation apprehended by
<i>reason</i> we call <i>Law</i>, and its embodiment Science; the
same apprehended by the imagination and æsthetic
sense, we call <i>Beauty</i>, and its embodiment <i>Art</i>, <i>music</i>.
Now, in music there are two kinds of harmony, simultaneous
and consecutive&mdash;chordal harmony and melody.
These must be combined to produce the grandest effect.
So in cosmic order, too, there are two kinds of harmonic
relation&mdash;the <i>co-existent in space</i> and the <i>consecutive in
time</i>. The law of gravitation expresses the universal
harmonic inter-relation of <i>objects</i> co-existent in space,
the law of evolution, the universal harmonic relation of
<i>forms</i> successive in time. Of the divine spheral music,
the one is the chordal harmony, the other the consecutive
harmony or melody. Combined they form the divine
chorus which “the morning stars sang together.”</p>

<span class="subhead">GENERAL EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION AS A UNIVERSAL
LAW.</span></h2>

<p>Let us again remind the reader that evolution means,
first of all, <i>continuity</i>. The law of evolution, although
it doubtless means much more, means, first of all, a law
of continuity, or <i>causal relation throughout Nature</i>. It
means that, alike in every department of Nature, each
state or condition grew <i>naturally</i> out of the immediately
preceding. In a word, it means that, in the course of
Nature, nothing appears suddenly and without natural
cause, but, on the contrary, everything is the natural and
usually the gradual outcome of a previous condition.
This is <i>now</i> admitted by every one in regard to <i>nearly</i>
everything: evolutionists apply it to the whole course of
Nature. I said this is <i>now</i> admitted by every one in
regard to <i>nearly</i> everything; but this has not always
been so. The world has come to its present position on
this subject only by a very gradual process. Let us then
trace rapidly the history of the gradual change, for it
will prepare us for much that follows.</p>

<p>There was a time (and that not many decades ago)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
when all things, the origin of which transcends our ordinary
experience, were supposed to have originated suddenly
and without natural process&mdash;to have been made
at once, out of hand. There was a time when, for example,
mountains were supposed to have been made at
once, with all their diversified forms, of beetling cliffs and
thundering waterfalls, or gentle slopes and smiling valleys,
just as we now find them. But <i>now</i> we know that
they have become so only by a very gradual process, and
are still changing under our very eyes. In a word, they
have been formed by a <i>process of evolution</i>. We know
now the date of mountain-births; we trace their growth,
maturity, decay, and death; and find even, as it were, the
fossil bones of extinct mountains in the crumpled strata
of their former places. There was a time when continents
and seas, gulfs, bays, and rivers, were supposed to have
originated at once, substantially as we now see them.
<i>Now</i>, we know that they have been changing throughout
all geological time, and are still changing. Not, however,
change back and forth in any direction indifferently and
without goal, but gradual change from less perfect to
more perfect condition, with more and more complex inter-relations&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
by a <i>process of evolution</i>. We are able
now, though still imperfectly, to trace some of the stages
of this evolution. There was a time when rocks and
soils were supposed to have been always rocks and soils;
when soils were regarded as an original clothing made on
purpose to hide the rocky nakedness of the new-born
earth. God clothed the earth so, and there an end. <i>Now</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
we know that rocks rot down to soils; soils are carried
down and deposited as sediments; and sediments re-consolidate
as rocks&mdash;the same materials being worked
over and over again, passing through all these stages
many times in the history of the earth. In a word,
there was a time when it was thought that the earth
with substantially its present form, configuration, and
climate, was made at once out of hand, as a fit habitation
for man and animals. <i>Now</i> we know that it has been
changing, preparing, becoming what it is by a slow process,
through a lapse of time so vast that the mind sinks
exhausted in the attempt to grasp it. It has become
what it now is by a <i>process of evolution</i>. The same
change of view has taken place concerning the origin of
all the heavenly bodies. We may, therefore, confidently
generalize&mdash;we may assert without fear of contradiction
that <i>all inorganic forms</i>, without exception, have originated
by a process of evolution.</p>

<p>The proof of all this we owe to geology&mdash;a science
born of the present century. This science establishes
the law of <i>universal continuity</i> of events, through infinite
<i>time</i>, as astronomy does that of <i>universal inter-relation</i>
of objects through infinite <i>space</i>. How great the
change these two sciences have made in the realm of
human thought! Until the birth of modern astronomy
the intellectual <i>space-horizon</i> of the human mind was
bounded substantially by the dimensions of our earth;
sun, moon, and stars, being but inconsiderable bodies
circulating at a little distance about the earth, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
our behoof. Astronomy was then but the geometry of
the curious lines traced by these wandering fires on the
concave blackboard of heaven. With the first glance
through a telescope the phases of Venus and the satellites
of Jupiter, revealed clearly to the mind the existence of
other worlds besides and like our own. In that moment
the idea of <i>infinite space</i>, full of worlds like our own, was
for the first time completely realized, and became thenceforward
the heritage of man. In that moment the <i>intellectual
horizon of man was infinitely extended</i>. So also
until the birth of geology, about the beginning of the
present century, the intellectual <i>time-horizon</i> of the
human mind was bounded by six thousand years. The
discovery about that time of vertebrate remains, all
wholly different from those now inhabiting the earth,
revealed the existence of other time-faunas, besides our
own and the idea of infinite time, of which the life of
humanity is but an epoch, was born in the mind of
man; and again the intellectual horizon of man was
infinitely extended. These two are the grandest ideas,
and their introduction the grandest epochs, in the intellectual
history of man. We have long ago accepted and
readjusted our mental furniture to the requirements of
the one, but the necessary readjustment to the other is
not yet complete.</p>

<p>All inorganic forms, then, it is admitted, have come
by evolution. But how is it with organic or living
forms? Let us see.</p>

<p>Every one knows, because it is within the limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of ordinary experience, that every <i>individual</i> organism
<i>now</i> originates and gradually becomes what we see it, by
a natural process&mdash;that is, by evolution. If, then, there
be any exception, it must be only the <i>first of each kind</i>.
But what kind? There are many kinds of kinds; classes,
orders, families, genera, species, varieties. Now, many
of these kinds can be shown to have become what we see
them by a gradual process similar, at least, to evolution.
Take for example, classes. The class of fishes and the
class of reptiles are <i>now</i> widely distinct and have little in
common except a vertebrate structure; but, as already
shown, <a href="#Page_12">page&nbsp;12</a>, this extreme difference has not always
existed. On the contrary, the earliest representatives of
these two classes so merged into one another that each
seemed either. From this common stock the two classes
were gradually separated, each going its own way and becoming
more and more widely distinct even to the present
day. There can be no doubt, therefore, that <i>these two
classes</i>, as we now know them, <i>have become</i> what they are
by a gradual process. Again: In the whole realm of
Nature there is not a class more distinctly separate from
every other and without intermediate links than birds.
But this has not always been so. They have gradually
become so. The earliest birds were so reptilian in structure
and appearance that if we could see them now we
would be in doubt whether we should call them birds or
reptiles. Birds have gradually separated themselves from
the reptilian stem, becoming more and more bird-like
from age to age, until now, at last, the two classes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
wholly separated and the intermediate links destroyed.
So far as external characters are concerned, birds may be
said to have finally and wholly released themselves from
entangling alliance with any other class.</p>

<p>Classes, then, it will be admitted, have undoubtedly
become what we now know them by a very gradual process
following laws identical (as we have already seen,
<a href="#Page_19">page&nbsp;19</a>) with the laws of evolution. Shall we try orders?
Of the class Mammalia there are two well-recognized
and widely-distinct <i>orders</i>, viz., the Carnivores
and the Herbivores. We all know how widely diverse
these are in form, in structure, in habits, and in food.
Has it always been so? Have these been made so at
once? By no means. They have gradually become so.
The earliest mammals were neither the one nor the other
distinctively. They were <i>omnivores</i>, completely intermediate
in food, habits, form, and structure. From this
common stock the two orders have gradually separated,
the carnivores becoming more and more adapted to one
mode of life and the herbivores to another, by a process
following the laws of evolution, as already explained.
Shall we try <i>families</i> and <i>genera</i>? Marsh and Huxley
have shown us how completely the horse family (<i>Equidæ</i>)
and the horse-genus (<i>Equus</i>) illustrate the process of
gradual becoming and the law of evolution. Under their
guidance, we see that the earliest traceable ancestor of
the horse family, before it was distinctively a horse family
at all, had on the fore-foot five toes in the Lower
Eocene, four toes in the Upper Eocene, and three toes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the Miocene; then we see the two side-toes shortening up
more and more in the Pliocene and becoming rudimentary
splints, leaving only one toe in the Quaternary and
present epochs. Thus, the side-splints in the foot of the
modern horse tell the story of its three-toed ancestry.
Similar gradual changes are clearly traceable in size,
shape, structure of limbs, of teeth, and of brain. In all
respects the members of the horse family have become
more and more horse-like in the course of time.</p>

<p>This subject will be taken up and more fully illustrated,
under the head of special evidences, in a subsequent
chapter. We here touch it only sufficiently to
illustrate this universal law of gradual becoming.</p>

<p>We have taken only a few examples, but the same is
undoubtedly true of all Taxonomic groups <i>above species</i>.
Passing over these last for the moment, we take next <i>races</i>
and <i>varieties</i>. These smaller groups are admitted by all
to be formed by a natural process, because not only can
we make them artificially, but all the intermediate links
may be found in Nature. So we have only <i>species</i> remaining.
Yes; species are imagined by the old-school
naturalist and by the anti-evolutionist of to-day as the
<i>ultimate elements</i> of Taxonomy. This, then, is the <i>last
ditch</i> upon which the defense of supernaturalism in the
realm of Nature is made. “Other groups,” they say,
“may have gradually become what they now are by the
successive introduction of specific forms according to a
preordained plan which is well expressed by the formal
laws of evolution. But <i>species</i> are without transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
forms. <i>They</i> come in suddenly, remain unchanged while
they continue, and finally pass out suddenly, so far as
specific characters are concerned. New species come in
their places by direct act of creation&mdash;by <i>substitution</i>,
not by transmutation.” This, then, is the last intrenchment.
Can we give any good evidence of gradual formation
of species? I believe we can.</p>

<p>First, then, it is admitted that we can easily make
varieties and races artificially. We will not <i>now</i> describe
the process; we are all familiar with the results, viz.,
the varieties of domestic animals and of useful and ornamental
plants; the extremely different breeds of horses,
cattle, sheep, dogs, pigeons, etc.; of wheat, cabbages,
turnips; of roses, dahlias, etc., etc. No one will doubt
that the extreme varieties of any of these, say greyhound
and pug, if wild, would be called distinct species, or
even distinct genera. We do not call them so, for two
reasons: first, because we see them made; and, second,
because we find all intermediate links between them;
and the usual definition of species is that they can not
be made, and they have no intermediate links. Thus,
then, the question is narrowed down to <i>wild species</i>.
They say: “We take our stand on these” (surely a very
narrow ground for so broad a philosophy). “We defy
you to show gradual formation with intermediate links.”</p>

<p>Now, in fact, by diligent search such intermediate
links between well-recognized species have been found in
some cases, especially in birds, on account of their great
power of dispersal. Certain forms have long been known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
from widely-separated regions, and universally regarded
as distinct species, as distinct as any. Then, by minute
examinations of intermediate regions, a complete series of
intermediate forms has been picked up. This has occurred
not only in one case but in many cases, and not
in birds only but in many other classes&mdash;examples increase
with our increasing <span class="locked">knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> The only answer
to such evidence is that <i>these are not true species</i>. Now,
see the fallacy lurking here! They define species as ultimate
elements of taxonomy, as distinct and without
intermediate links, and then require us to find such intermediate
links; and, finally, when with infinite pains
some such links are found, they say: “Oh! I see; we
were mistaken; they are only varieties!!” It is true
that naturalists, when intermediate links are found, usually
put all together as one species, but this they do
purely for the sake of clearness of definition and description.
It is freely admitted by the evolutionist that species
are <i>now</i> usually distinct and without intermediate
links, these having been destroyed in the struggle for
life. This will be fully explained in another chapter.
It is also freely admitted that although intermediate
links must have existed at one time, their remains are
rarely found. The reason of this will also be explained
hereafter. Nevertheless, in some cases, as already seen,
we do find them still existing. Now, we add that in
some cases, where they no longer exist, we find them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the form of fossil remains. The most remarkable example
of this is found in the gradual changes in the forms
of Planorbis in the fresh-water deposits of Steinheim, as
shown by the admirable researches of <span class="locked">Hyatt.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> We shall
discuss these also more fully in another place. Now, if
there be any such links at all, however rare, then every
objection to the derivative origin of species is removed.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be well to make bare mention of
another kind of evidence, viz., the actual change of species
under the eyes, by the action of change of environment.
The different species of the genus <i>Artemia</i> (a low
form of crustacean) live in brine-pools. By concentrating
the brine of such a pool, one species (<i>A. salina</i>) has
been observed to change in successive generations into
another (<i>A. Muhlhausenii</i>), and the latter back again to
the former by slow <span class="locked">freshening.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> Again: The siredon
and the amblystoma have always, until recently, been regarded
as not only distinct species, but distinct genera
of amphibians. Siredon was supposed to be a permanent
gill-breather, while amblystoma becomes by metamorphosis
a pure air-breather. Now, however, it is known that
the former may change into the latter. But the most
curious part of the life-history of these animals, is that
if water be abundant the siredon reproduces freely, and
remains indefinitely a gill-breather; but if the water
dries up it changes into the lung-breathing amblystoma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
We do not give this as examples of change of species,
for the change is in the individual life, and therefore in
the nature of metamorphosis, but as evidence of the
power of physical conditions in modifying the development
of organic forms and therefore of the manner in
which gill-breathers were probably transformed into air-breathers.</p>

<p>To sum up: 1. All <i>inorganic</i> forms, without exception,
have become what we find them by a natural process&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
by evolution. 2. All <i>organic</i> or living forms
within the <i>limits of observation</i>, i.&nbsp;e., every living thing,
has become what we now see, by a gradual, natural process&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
by evolution. 3. All taxonomic groups, except
species, have undoubtedly become what we now see them
by a gradual process, following the laws of evolution, and
therefore presumably by a natural process of evolution.
4. By artificial means, breeds, races, etc., very similar,
at least in many respects, to species, are seen to arise by a
gradual natural process&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., by evolution. 5. In some
instances, at least, natural species are observed to pass
into one another by intermediate links in such wise that
we are forced to conclude that they have been formed by
a natural process.</p>

<p>May we not, then, safely generalize, and make the
law universal? Is not this a sufficient ground for confident
induction? Even though some facts are still inexplicable,
is that a sufficient reason for withholding assent
to a theory which explains so much? In all induction
we first establish a law provisionally from the observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
of a comparatively few facts, and then extend it over a
multitude of facts not included in the original induction.
If it explains these also, the law is verified. The law of
gravitation was first based on the observation of a few
facts, and then verified by its explanation of nearly all
the facts of celestial motion. There are some outstanding
facts of celestial motion still unexplained, but we do
not, therefore, doubt the law of gravitation. The same
principle applied in biology ought to establish the law of
evolution, for it also explains all the facts of biology as
no other law can. But inductive evidence differs from
other kinds of evidence in one respect, which, in fact,
constitutes its strength to the scientific, but its weakness
to the popular mind. It is a kind of circumstantial evidence,
but its force does not consist in a few strong circumstances
easily appreciated, such as strike the popular
mind, and force conviction, but rather in a multitude of
small circumstances, each by itself insignificant, but all
together pointing to one conclusion and demanding one
explanation. Such evidence is, indeed, overwhelming,
but only to the mind that masters it. The evidence for
the law of gravitation is literally the whole science of astronomy.
So also the evidence for the law of evolution is
the whole science of biology. Neither of these laws can
be proved in a debating society, but only by a course of
study. In the one case the law has been universally accepted&mdash;not,
however, on evidence, for there are few indeed
who appreciate the evidence, but on the authority
of scientific unanimity. In the other case there has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
yet been time enough for the already established unanimity
to have its full effect.</p>

<p>Thus much, we believe, will be generally admitted as
a very moderate claim. Evolution is certainly a legitimate
induction from the facts of biology. But we are
prepared to go much further. We are confident that
evolution is <i>absolutely certain</i>. Not, indeed, evolution as
a special theory&mdash;Lamarckian, Darwinian, Spencerian&mdash;for
these are all more or less successful modes of explaining
evolution; nor evolution as a school of thought, with
its following of disciples&mdash;for in this sense it is still in
the field of discussion&mdash;but evolution as a law of derivation
of forms from previous forms; evolution as a law
of continuity, as a universal law of becoming. In this
sense it is not only certain, it is axiomatic. It is only
necessary to conceive it clearly, to see that it is a necessary
truth. This may seem paradoxical to some. I stop
to justify it.</p>

<p>Physical phenomena we all admit follow one another
in unbroken succession, each derived from a preceding,
and giving origin to a succeeding. We call this the law
of causation, and say that it is axiomatic. We might call
it a law of derivation. So also organic <i>forms</i> follow
one another in continuous chain, each derived from a
preceding and giving origin to a succeeding. We call
this a law of derivation. We might call it a <i>law of causation</i>,
and say that it too is axiomatic. The origins of
new phenomena are often obscure, even inexplicable,
but we never think to doubt that they have a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
cause; for so to doubt is to doubt the validity of reason,
and the rational constitution of Nature. So also the origins
of new organic <i>forms</i> may be obscure or even inexplicable,
but we ought not on that account to doubt
that they had a natural cause, and came by a natural
process; for so to doubt is also to doubt the validity of
reason, and the rational constitution of organic Nature.
The law of evolution is naught else than the scientific or,
indeed, the rational mode of thinking about the origin of
things in every department of Nature. In a word, it is
naught else than the law of necessary causation applied
to <i>forms</i> instead of phenomena. Evolution, therefore, is
no longer a school of thought. The words <i>evolutionism</i>
and <i>evolutionist</i> ought not any longer to be used, any
more than <i>gravitationism</i> and <i>gravitationist</i>; for the law
of evolution is as certain as the law of gravitation. Nay,
it is far more certain. The nexus between <i>successive
events in time</i> (causation) is far more certain than the
nexus between <i>coexistent objects in space</i> (gravitation).
The former <i>is a necessary truth</i>, the latter is usually
classed as a contingent truth. I have used and may
continue to use the term evolutionist, but if so it is
only in deference to the views of many intelligent persons,
who do not yet see the certainty of the law.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPECIAL PROOFS OF EVOLUTION.</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>Introductory.</i></span></h2>

<p>It will be seen from the preceding chapter that we
regard the law of evolution in its wider sense, viz., the
derivative origin of all forms, organic or other, as axiomatic,
and therefore requiring no further proof. Among
scientific men there is no longer any discussion of the
truth of this law, but only of the theories of the causes
of the law. We believe that to the scientific mind there
is no other rational mode of looking at the subject of
origin of organic forms. To such a mind, therefore, all
that follows is but the deductive application of that law
in the explanation of the phenomena of organic Nature.
But it takes time for the popular mind to readjust itself
to new and revolutionary truth. Many minds, even
among the most intelligent, have not yet accepted this as
the only rational mode of thought. Many men require
further <i>special proofs</i> of the derivative origin of organic
forms. Even to those who accept evolution, these proofs
will be interesting as illustrations of such origin. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
will attempt to bring out these proofs under several
heads, the most important of which are: 1. Proofs from
morphology, or the general laws of animal structure; 2.
Proofs from embryology; 3. Proofs from geographical
distribution of organic forms; and, 4. Proofs from artificial
breeding. The subject is so vast that all we can do
is to touch lightly only the most salient points under
each of these heads; for, as we have already said, the evidence
is really nothing less than the whole science of
biology. Preparatory to this, however, it is necessary to
bring out a little more fully than before (<a href="#Page_29">page&nbsp;29</a>),
though still only in outline, the two antagonistic views,
which may be called the old and the new, or the natural
and the supernatural, of the origin of new organic forms,
especially species.</p>

<p><b>Origin of New Organic Forms; the Old View briefly
stated.</b>&mdash;According to the old-school naturalists, species
are the ultimate elements of taxonomy: genera, families,
orders, etc., may gradually change their character from
age to age, by the introduction of new species; but species
were supposed to be substantially <i>permanent</i>. It was
necessary to have some unit for convenience of description
and classification, and this was found to be the best
because most stable. As in nearly all cases of beliefs,
this doctrine was held at first somewhat loosely, as a provisional
and convenient view&mdash;as a good working hypothesis&mdash;but
gradually, under pressure of controversy,
became more strictly formulated, and, as it were, hardened
into a scientific dogma, especially in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Agassiz. According to this view, the first pair or pairs
of each specific kind originated we know not how, but
certainly <i>at once in its present form</i> in full perfection,
and, therefore, presumably by <i>direct creative</i> act of
Deity; and then afterward by the law of generation continued
to produce others of the same pattern indefinitely.
Moreover, the first one or more pairs of each kind multiplied
and spread abroad in every direction, <i>each from its
own center of origin</i>, as far as physical conditions and
struggle for life with other species would allow. This
idea explains tolerably well the geographical distribution
of species as we now find it. For example, species on
different continents are widely different, because those
on each have originated independently where we now
find them, and spread in all directions as far as physical
conditions would allow, but could not reach other continents
because of the ocean-barrier. That this is the
only reason they are not there, is shown by the fact that,
if they are carried there, they usually do perfectly well.
Even on the same continent, for the same reason, species
may be very different if separated by impassable barriers
such as high mountain-chains or by climate. But
wherever one group of species, originating in one place,
comes in contact on the margin of their range with
another group of species originating in another place,
we see no evidence of <i>transmutation</i> of one form <i>into</i>
another, but only <i>substitution</i> of one fully-formed species
<i>for</i> another equally fully formed. Therefore, we
must conclude that physical conditions may limit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
range of a species, but can not transmute it into another.
Thus, to say the least, many of the facts of geographical
distribution are well explained by this idea of creative
origin in specific centers and subsequent permanence of
specific form. We say <i>many</i> of the facts; we will show
hereafter that <i>not all</i> can be thus explained.</p>

<p>But the main question is not of geographical but of
geological distribution; not distribution in space, but
succession in time. Species do not continue forever. On
the contrary, they have changed many times in the
course of geological history. As conditions become unfavorable,
species die out or become extinct, and others
take their place and carry forward the life and development
of the organic kingdom. Now, how do they
change? According to this school of thought, here also,
as in geographical distribution, they are not transmuted
but replaced; here also physical conditions may destroy
a species, but can not transform it into another. As species
die out, others are created at once, out of hand and
fully formed in their place; but in accordance with a
preordained plan consistently carried out and working
ever toward higher and higher conditions. Thus, life is
continued on the earth by the alternation of supernatural
and natural processes; by the alternate use of direct
and indirect action of Deity: direct in the introduction
of first pairs, indirect through the natural process of reproduction
in the continuance and multiplication of the
species. Each species is made according to a pattern in
the Divine mind, on a sort of intellectual die, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
continues to reproduce a succession of individuals of the
same pattern as if struck from the same die until the die
is broken or worn out. Another die is made, of another
pattern, and individuals are struck from this; and so on,
throughout the whole geological history of the organic
kingdom. Only, we must add that the successive dies
are made to follow one another according to a plan which
is expressed by the three laws already given on <a href="#Page_11">page&nbsp;11</a>.
Thus, the origin of individuals is natural, the origin
of species supernatural; the making of dies is supernatural,
the coinage is natural.</p>

<p>We have stated this view in a too extreme form, in
order to make it clearer. We now, therefore, proceed to
qualify somewhat. Specific types were held, by writers
of this school of thought, to be <i>substantially</i> but not
absolutely unchangeable. Successive individuals of the
same species were admitted to be not exactly alike.
Such slight differences were called <i>varieties</i>. It was admitted,
indeed, that species varied, but it was believed
that such variations in any direction were strictly limited
in amount. A species may be compared to a right cylinder
standing on end. As such a cylinder may be tilted
slightly in one direction or another, without overthrowing
its equilibrium, the cylinder tending ever to right
itself and return to its original position, so a species
may be varied slightly in one direction or another without
destroying its integrity, the species tending ever to
return to its normal or typical form. But as the cylinder,
if pushed too far from its normal position, is overthrown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
so also a species, if pressed too far in the way of
variation from its typical form, is destroyed, but not
changed into another species. As cylinders may be more
or less rigid, depending upon the breadth of their bases,
so also some species are more rigidly set in their typical
form, and some are more plastic to influences causing
variations, but in all cases there is a limit to the amount
of oscillation consistent with integrity.</p>

<p><b>The New View briefly stated.</b>&mdash;According to Darwin,
and all biologists of the present day, species are variable
<i>without limit</i>, if only the causes of change are constant and
slow enough in their operation, and the time long enough.
A species must be in harmony with its environment, for
this is the condition of its existence. Now, if the environment
change, the species must <i>tend</i> to change slowly
from generation to generation, so as to readjust its relations
in harmony with the changing environment. If
the change of environment be slow, the readjustment
may be successful, and the species will change gradually
into another form, so different that it will be called a
different species, especially if the intermediate gradations
be destroyed. If the change in the environment be too
rapid, many species, especially the more rigid, will be
destroyed, while the more plastic may survive by modification.
Thus, at every step in the evolution of the organic
kingdom, some species have died without issue,
while others have saved themselves by changing into new
forms in harmony with the new environment. Comparing
to a growing tree, some branches overshadowed die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
while others push on for light, forming new lateral buds,
and dividing as they grow. By continued divergent
change species gradually become genera, genera families,
etc. Thus, varieties, species, genera, families, orders,
classes, etc., are only different degrees of differences
formed all in the same way. Varieties are only commencing
species, species commencing genera, and so on.
There is no making and wearing out of dies, and making
of new ones; the whole process is a natural one&mdash;the
whole series is genetically connected. In a perfect classification
varieties, species, genera, families, orders, classes,
etc., are only different <i>degrees of blood-kinship</i>.</p>

<p>So much may be regarded as certain, and out of the
field of discussion among biologists of the present day.
It is only in defining this process more accurately, and
especially in the <i>theory of the causes</i> or <i>factors</i> of evolution,
that there are still difference and discussion. The
most probable view on this subject we now proceed to
give.</p>

<p><b>Factors of Evolution.</b>&mdash;The causes of change or adaptive
modification, or the factors of evolution, are at least
<i>four</i> well known, and probably many more still unknown:
1. The physical environment&mdash;heat and cold,
dryness and moisture&mdash;affects function of organs, and
function affects structure, and both changed function
and changed structure are inherited by offspring, and
so increased from generation to generation, becoming
greater without limit. 2. Increased <i>use</i> or <i>disuse</i> of
organs enforced or permitted by change in the environment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
physical or organic, or both, induces change in
form, size, and structure of the organs; and this change
is inherited by the offspring, and so from generation to
generation small differences are integrated until they become
great without limit. These two factors were recognized
by Lamarck. 3. “Natural selection,” or “survival
of the fittest,” among divergent varieties of offspring.
This is the distinctive Darwinian factor. In the two
preceding factors the change is during the <i>individual
lifetime</i>, and reproduction is supposed to transmit it unchanged
to the offspring. In this factor, on the contrary,
the form and structure are supposed to remain unchanged
during the individual life, but for some unknown
cause there are slight variations in different directions
(divergent) in the offspring from the same parents.
Now, when we remember that by reproduction the number
of individuals tends to increase by geometrical progression,
and that in each generation only a very few (on
an average only two from all the offspring of one pair)
can survive, it is evident that among these divergent varieties
those will most likely survive which are most in
harmony with the external environment, and which possess
the most efficient organs of defense or of escape, or
for food-taking. The surviving offspring, therefore, will
be on the average better in these respects than their parents.
It matters not how little better, for the integration
of even infinitesimal improvements from generation to
generation will eventually produce any required amount
of change. 4. To the above Darwin has added also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
“<i>sexual selection</i>.” In <i>natural</i> selection there is struggle
of <i>all</i> for <i>food</i>, or <i>means of living</i>. In sexual selection
there is a struggle among the <i>males</i> for possession of the
<i>female</i>, and the <i>means of procreation</i>. The one is connected
with the nutritive appetite, the other with the
reproductive appetite. This mode of selection acts in two
ways, by the law of battle and the law of attractiveness.
The strongest or the most attractive males alone, or
mainly, leave offspring, which, of course, inherit their
peculiarities; and these are increased indefinitely by
integration through successive generations, thus increasing
the strength or the beauty. Of these two laws, the
law of battle is most conspicuous among mammals, and
the law of attractiveness among birds. It is evident that
this factor can not operate among many lower animals
which are hermaphroditic, nor among plants.</p>

<p>Of these acknowledged factors of evolution, the first
two were known to Lamarck and the older evolutionists.
The third and fourth are distinctively Darwinian. According
to Darwin, while all these are operative, the third
is the most powerful; but Spencer accords this distinction
to the Lamarckian factors. Many American zoölogists
take the same view.</p>

<p>Such until very recently were all the recognized factors
of evolution. But, within the past year (1886) has
taken place, it seems to us, the most important advance
in the theory of evolution since Darwin. It is the suggestion
by Mr. <span class="locked">Catchpool,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> and afterward the more full elaboration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
by Dr. Romanes, of another factor, which he calls
“<i>physiological selection</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The great objections to the sufficiency of the theory
of evolution, as left by Darwin, were twofold: 1. While
natural selection accounts completely for the formation
of <i>useful</i> structures or adaptive modifications, and
therefore for differences characterizing classes, orders,
families, and even genera&mdash;for these are all adaptive&mdash;it
can not so completely account for those constituting
species; for these consist mostly of <i>trivial</i> differences
in coloration, relative proportion of parts, which
are of <i>no perceivable use</i> in the struggle for life, and
therefore could not be preserved and integrated by
natural selection. Therefore, according to Romanes,
natural selection is a theory of origin of adaptive structures
rather than of origin of species. Comparing to a
growing tree, once admit lateral buds started, and natural
selection completely accounts for the growth in different
directions, and therefore for the profuse ramification;
but the origin of the lateral buds is not explained.</p>

<p>2. The second difficulty is as follows: Such commencing
differences as constitute varieties and species
not only would not be preserved and integrated by natural
selection unless useful, but would immediately be
<i>swamped by cross-breeding</i> with the parental form. But,
as the whole divergence commences in varieties, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
it could not commence at all unless this cross-breeding
be in some way prevented. This may, indeed,
be done, without the assumption of any new factor of
evolution, by <i>migration</i>; and, hence, migration must be
regarded as an important agent in the creation of new
forms, not only by the effect of a new environment, but
also by prevention of the swamping of commencing
species by cross-breeding with the parental form; but in
a crowded locality, without outlet for migration (the very
conditions most favorable for severe competitive struggle,
and therefore for most potent operation of natural
selection; and therefore, also, according to Darwin, for
profuse diversification), commencing varieties could not
pass into species, because swamped by cross-breeding.
Once the divergence reaches the point of cross-sterility&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
of species&mdash;then, indeed, by true breeding, characters,
even though not useful, may be preserved. But
how is it to commence?</p>

<p>This difficulty has been severely felt by all Darwinists.
It seems to us that it is largely met by Dr. Romanes.
According to Romanes, no organ is so subject
to varietal changes as the <i>reproductive</i>, and these in no
respect so much as in degrees of fertility. Unfortunately,
these changes are not visible, and must be judged of
only by the results. It is not uncommon, for example, to
find sterility between individuals (sexual incompatibility)
who are both of them perfectly fertile with other individuals.
Similarly, cross-sterility, partial or complete, is
not uncommon between varieties or races, as Mr. Darwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
has long ago noticed. It very generally, as we know,
occurs between, and, in fact, is constantly used as a test
of, species. Now, this cross-sterility with parent stock,
which we find so constant a character of species, and
which, therefore, must <i>have commenced as a partial cross-sterility</i>
in varieties, is it <i>antecedent or consequent to
other variations</i>? It has been usual to suppose it consequent
to a certain amount of divergence, viz., that which
constitutes, or at least approaches, species. But, according
to Romanes, it is <i>antecedent</i>. Among many other
variations, this is that one which originates species, because
it prevents reversion by cross-breeding with the
parent stock, and insures true breeding with its own
kind. In a word, it sexually isolates the species. Suppose,
then, a species multiplying indefinitely in one locality:
trivial variations of many kinds, and in many
directions, occur among the offspring. These are merged
by cross-breeding into the original type, which, therefore,
remains unchanged. But, from time to time, among
these variations there occur some affecting the reproductive
organs in such wise as to produce partial or complete
cross-sterility with the parent form. This is the beginning
of a new species. It breeds true with its own kind,
and therefore all the associated variations external and
visible, and therefore constituting species, although trivial
and of no use in the struggle for life, are preserved.</p>

<p>This view completely accounts for the cross-fertility
of artificial breeds equivalent in other respects to species;
for cross-sterility is not an end aimed at by the breeder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
it being easy to prevent cross-breeding, if desired, by
artificial isolation. But, if this view be true, species
from widely-different geographical regions ought also to
be often cross-fertile, because, having been formed by
geographical isolation, sexual isolation was not a necessary
factor in their formation. This point deserves testing
by careful observation.</p>

<p>It may be, and has been, objected to Dr. Romanes’s
claims, that this is no new factor; that physiological
selection is only a form of natural selection. This objection,
it seems to us, is little more than a play upon
words. It certainly is selection, and by a <i>natural</i> process,
and therefore in some sense a natural selection, but
not in the sense of Darwin. It is not a selection of individuals
<i>fittest to survive</i>; for cross-fertile individuals are
as fit to survive as individuals, though not as species, as
are cross-sterile. Natural selection is intent only on preserving
the best individuals; physiological selection on
preserving the kind. Natural selection continues the
direction of progress unchanged; physiological makes
new directions.</p>

<p>In addition to all these factors of <i>organic</i> evolution,
there is still another far higher factor characteristic of
man alone. This is the <i>conscious, voluntary co-operation
of the thing evolving&mdash;the spirit of man&mdash;in the work of
its own evolution</i>. This may be called the <i>rational factor</i>.
This, the most important factor of human evolution, is
usually ignored by writers on evolution&mdash;either as non-existent,
or else as lying beyond the domain of science.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
We will emphasize its importance by taking it up more
fully in the next chapter.</p>

<p>It will be observed that Darwin and his followers take
divergent variations of offspring simply as a known fact,
upon which natural selection operates to produce progressive
modification; and, as the cause of variation in
offspring is wholly unknown, such variations are often
spoken of as fortuitous. But, of course, it is well understood
that nothing in Nature is really fortuitous. They
may, however, for all purposes of natural selection be
thus regarded until we know their cause. It is evident,
then, that if we, with Darwin, take natural selection, as
the most important known factor, the really most important
cause of evolution is the <i>cause</i> of varieties. This is
the <i>unknown</i> fundamental factor. As Darwin reduced
Agassiz’s three formal laws of succession to more general
laws of life, and thus made one important step in the
advance of biological science, so he who shall explain the
<i>cause</i> of divergent variation will make another important
step by reducing the phenomena to still more general
and fundamental laws of life.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me again impress upon the reader
that all the doubt and discussion, above described, as to
the factors of evolution, is entirely aside from the truth
of evolution itself, concerning which there is no difference
of opinion among thinkers.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GRADES OF THE FACTORS OF EVOLUTION AND THE
ORDER OF THEIR APPEARANCE.</span></h2>

<p>We have given in the previous chapter six factors of
evolution&mdash;viz.: 1. <i>Pressure of the environment.</i> 2. <i>Use
and disuse of parts.</i> 3. <i>Natural selection.</i> 4. <i>Sexual
selection.</i> 5. <i>Physiological selection.</i> 6. <i>Reason.</i> Let
us now compare these as to their grade in the scale of
energy and as to the order of their introduction.</p>

<p>The first two or the Lamarckian factors are the lowest
in position, the most fundamental and universal, and
therefore the first in the order of appearance. They precede
all other factors, and were doubtless for a long time
<i>the only ones in operation</i>. For, observe, all the selective
factors&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., those of Darwin and Romanes&mdash;are conditioned
on reproduction; for the changes produced by these
are not in the individual during life, but in the offspring
at birth. And not only so, but the operations of these factors
are further conditioned on <i>sexual modes</i> of reproduction;
for all the non-sexual modes of reproduction&mdash;as,
for example, by fissure and by budding&mdash;are but slight
modifications of growth, and the resulting multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
organisms may be regarded as in some sense <i>only an extension
of the first individual</i>. Of course, therefore, the
identical characters of the first individual are continued
indefinitely, except in so far as they are modified in successive
generations by the effect of the environment and
by use and disuse&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., by the Lamarckian factors. In
sexual generation, on the contrary, the characters of two
diverse individuals are funded in a common offspring;
and the same continuing through successive generations,
it is evident that the inheritance in each individual offspring
is infinitely multiple. Now, the <i>tendency to variation</i>
in offspring <i>is in proportion to the multiplicity of
the inheritance</i>: for among the infinite number of slightly
differing characters, as it were, offered for inheritance
in each generation, some individuals will inherit more of
one and some more of another character. In a word,
sexual reproduction by multiple inheritance <i>tends to variation
of offspring, and thus furnishes material for natural
selection</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Thus, then, I repeat, all the selective factors are absolutely
dependent on sexual modes of reproduction.
But there was a time when this mode of reproduction
did not yet <span class="locked">exist.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> The sexual modes developed out of
non-sexual modes. If these non-sexual preceded sexual
modes of reproduction, it is evident that at first only
Lamarckian factors could operate. Evolution was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
carried forward wholly by changes in the individual produced
by environment and by use and disuse (acquired
characters), inherited and increased by integration
through successive generations indefinitely. It is probable,
therefore, that the <i>rate</i> of evolution was at first
comparatively slow; unless, indeed, as seems probable, the
<i>earliest</i> forms <i>were then</i> and the <i>lowest</i> forms <i>are now</i>
more plastic under the influence of physical conditions
than are the present higher forms. Doubtless, now, in
the higher animals and plants, the Darwinian factors are
by far the most potent; for, among plants, where we can
use these factors separately, if we wish to <i>make</i> varieties,
we propagate by seeds (sexual reproduction); but, if we
wish to preserve varieties, we propagate by buds and cuttings
(non-sexual reproduction).</p>

<p>I have taken the two Lamarckian factors together,
and showed that they preceded the Darwinian. But even
in the two Lamarckian factors there is a difference in
grade. Undoubtedly the lowest, the most fundamental,
and therefore the first introduced, was <i>pressure of the
physical environment</i>. For use and disuse of organs
implies some degree of volition and voluntary motion,
and therefore already some advance in the scale of evolution.</p>

<p>With the introduction of sex another entirely different
and higher factor was introduced, viz., <i>natural selection</i>,
or selection of the fittest individuals of a varying
progeny. We have already seen how sexual generation
produces variation of offspring, and how this furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
materials for natural selection. As soon, therefore, as
this form of generation was evolved, this higher factor
came into operation and immediately assumed control;
while the previous factors became subordinate, though
still underlying, conditioning, and modifying the activity
of the higher. The result was an immediate increase in
the rate of evolution. It is very worthy of note that it
is in the higher animals, such as birds and mammals, in
which we have only the highest forms of sexual reproduction,
where the diversity of characters of the two
sexes funded in the offspring is the greatest, and where,
therefore, the variation in offspring is also greatest and
natural selection most active; it is precisely among these
that the Lamarckian factors are most feeble, because,
during the most plastic period of life, the offspring is
removed from the influence of the physical environment,
and from use and disuse by its inclosure within the
womb, or within a large egg surrounded with abundant
nutriment. Development is already well advanced before
Lamarckian factors can operate at all.</p>

<p>Next, I suppose, physiological selection, or Romanes’s
factor, came into operation. After the introduction of
sex, it became necessary that the individuals of some
varieties should be isolated in some way, so as to prevent
the swamping of varietal characters, as fast as formed, in
a common stock, by <i>cross-breeding</i>. In very low forms,
with slow locomotion, such isolation might easily take
place accidentally. Even in higher forms, changes in
physical geography or accidental dispersion by winds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
currents would often produce geographical isolation, and
thus, by preventing crossing with the parent stock, secure
the formation of new species from such isolated varieties.
But, in order to insure in all cases the preservation of
commencing species, <i>sexual isolation</i>, or partial or complete
infertility of some varieties with other varieties and
with the parent stock, was introduced, as I suppose, later.
The process by which this takes place has already been
explained. According to Romanes, natural selection
alone, with cross-breeding, tends to <i>monotypal</i> evolution;
isolation of some kind is necessary for polytypal evolution.
The tree of evolution, under the influence of natural
selection alone, grows, palm-like, from its <i>terminal
bud</i>; isolation of varieties was necessary for the starting
of <i>lateral buds</i>, and thus for the profuse ramification
which is its most conspicuous character.</p>

<p>Next, I suppose, was introduced <i>sexual selection</i>, or
contest among the males, by battle or by display, for possession
of the females, and the success of the strongest or
the most attractive; and the perpetuation and increase of
these superior qualities of strength and beauty in the
next generation. This, I suppose, was later, because connected
with a higher development of the psychical nature.
This is especially true where splendor of color or
beauty of song determines the selection. As might be
supposed, therefore, this factor is operative only among
the highest animals, especially birds and <span class="locked">mammals.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Next and last, and only with the appearance of <i>Man</i>,
another entirely different and far higher factor was introduced,
viz., <i>conscious, voluntary co-operation</i> in the work
of his own evolution&mdash;a conscious, voluntary striving to
<i>attain an ideal</i>. We have called this a factor, but it is
much more than a mere factor, co-ordinate with other
factors. It is, rather, a different kind of evolution. It is
evolution on a higher plane and by another nature. As
<i>physical</i> Nature works <i>unconsciously</i>, using certain factors,
so <i>spiritual</i> nature works <i>consciously</i>, co-operating
and using the same factors. At first this factor, if we
still call it so, was extremely feeble. In the early stages
of his progress, man, like other animals, was largely
urged on by forces of organic evolution, unknowing and
uncaring whither he tended. But more and more, as
civilization advances, this higher and distinctively human
factor becomes more and more dominant, until now, in
civilized communities, it takes control of evolution.
Reason, instead of Nature, now assumes control, though
still using the methods and factors of Nature. This <i>free</i>,
self-determined evolution of the race, in order to distinguish
it from the <i>necessary</i> evolution of the organic
kingdom, we call progress.</p>

<p>Now, in this whole process we observe two striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
stages. The one is the introduction of sex, the other is
the introduction of <span class="locked">reason.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> They may be compared to
two equally striking stages in the development of the
<i>individual</i>. As the <i>ontogenic</i> evolution receives fresh
impulse at the moment of fertilization, so the evolution of
the organic kingdom receives fresh impulse at the moment
of introduction of sex. As in ontogenic evolution
the individual at birth enters upon a new and higher
plane, in which it co-operates in its own <i>physical</i> growth,
so the organic kingdom, with the introduction of man,
enters upon a new and higher plane, in which man co-operates
in the physical and <i>spiritual</i> growth of the race.
With sex three new and higher factors were introduced,
and these immediately assumed control and quickened
the rate of evolution. With reason another and infinitely
higher factor is introduced, which, in its turn, assumes
control, and not only again quickens the rate, but elevates
the whole plane of evolution. Moreover, this voluntary,
rational factor not only takes control itself, but
transforms all other factors and uses them in a new way
and for its own higher purposes.</p>

<p>This last is by far the greatest change which has ever
occurred in the history of evolution. In organic evolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Nature operates by necessary law without the conscious
voluntary co-operation of the thing evolving. In
human progress man voluntarily co-operates with Nature
in the work of evolution, and even assumes to take the process
mainly into his own hands. Organic evolution is by
<i>necessary</i> law, human progress by <i>free</i> or at least by freer
law. Organic evolution is by a <i>pushing</i> upward and
onward from <i>below</i> and <i>behind</i>, human progress by a
<i>drawing</i> upward and onward from above and in front by
the attractive force of ideals. In a word, organic evolution
is by the law of <i>force</i>, human evolution by the law of <i>love</i>.</p>

<p>It may be well to stop a moment and show briefly
some of the differences between organic and human evolution&mdash;differences
which are, of course, wholly the result
of the introduction of this new factor:</p>

<p>1. In organic evolution “<i>the fittest</i>” are those most in
harmony with the physical environment, and therefore
they survive. In human evolution <i>the fittest</i> are those
most in harmony with <i>the ideal</i>, and often, especially in
the early stages, when the race is still largely under the
dominion of organic factors, they do not survive, because
not in harmony with the social environment. But, although
the fittest individuals may indeed perish, the <i>ideal</i>
survives in the race and will eventually triumph.</p>

<p>2. In organic evolution the weak, the sick, the helpless,
the unfit in any way perish and <i>ought to perish</i>, because
this is the most efficient way of strengthening the
<i>blood</i> or <i>physical nature</i> of the species, and thus of carrying
forward evolution. In human evolution the weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the helpless, the sick, the old, the unfit in any way are
sustained and <i>ought to be sustained</i>, because sympathy,
love, pity, strengthen the <i>spirit</i> or <i>moral nature</i> of the
race. But let us remember that in this material world of
ours and during this earthly life the spirit or moral nature
is conditioned on the physical nature; and, therefore, in
all our attempts to help the weak we must be careful to
avoid poisoning the blood and weakening the physical
vigor of the race by inheritance. This gravest of social
problems, viz., How shall we obey the higher law of love
and mutual help without weakening the <i>blood</i> of the race
by inheritance and the spirit of the race by removing the
necessity of self-help?&mdash;this problem, I believe, can and
will be solved by a <i>rational education</i>, physical, mental,
and moral. I only allude to this. It is too wide a field to
follow up here.</p>

<p>3. In organic evolution the bodily <i>form</i> and <i>structure</i>
must continually change in order to keep in harmony
with the ever-changing environment. In other words,
organic evolution is by continual change of species,
genera, families, etc. There must be continual evolution
of new forms by modification. In human evolution, on
the contrary, and more and more as civilization advances,
man modifies the environment so as to bring it into harmony
with himself and his wants, and therefore there is no
necessity of change of bodily form and structure or making
of new species of man. Human evolution is not by
modification of <i>form</i>&mdash;new species; but by modification of
spirit&mdash;new planes of activity, <i>higher character</i>. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
spirit is modified and character elevated, not by <i>pressure</i>
of an <i>external physical environment</i>, but by the <i>attractive</i>
force of an <i>internal spiritual ideal</i>.</p>

<p>4. The way of evolution toward the highest&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., from
protozoan to man and from lowest man to the ideal, the
divine man&mdash;is a very <i>straight and narrow way</i>, and few
there be that find it. In the case of organic evolution it
is so straight and so narrow that any divergence therefrom
is fatal to upward movement toward man. Once
get off the track, and it is <i>impossible</i> to get on again. No
living form of animal is on its way <i>manward</i>, or can by
any possibility develop into man. They are all gone out
of the way. There is none going right; no, not one.
The organic kingdom developing through all geological
times may be compared to a tree whose trunk is deeply
buried in the lowest strata, whose great limbs were separated
in early geological times, whose secondary branches
diverged in middle geological times, and whose extreme
twiglets, and also its graceful foliage, its beautiful flowers,
and luscious fruits, are the fauna and flora of the present
day. But this tree of evolution is an <i>excurrent stem</i>, continuous
through the clustering branches to the terminal
shoot&mdash;man. Once leave the stem as a branch, and it is
easy to continue growing in the direction chosen, but impossible
to get back on the straight upward way to the highest.
In human evolution, whether individual or racial, the
same law holds, but with a difference. If individual or
race gets off the straight, narrow way toward the highest&mdash;the
divine ideal&mdash;it is hard, very hard to get back on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the track. Hard, I say, but <i>not</i> impossible, because
man’s conscious voluntary effort is the chief factor in his
own evolution. By virtue of self-activity, through the
use of reason and co-operation in the work of evolution,
man alone of all created things is able to rectify an error
of direction and return again to the deserted way.</p>

<p>5. In organic evolution, when a higher factor appears,
it immediately assumes control, and previous lower factors
sink into a subordinate position, though still underlying
and conditioning the higher. But in human evolution,
the higher rational factor, when it comes in with man,
not only assumes control, but transforms all other factors
and uses them in a new way and for its own higher purposes.
In fact, as already said, it is much more than a
mere factor. It determines a new kind of evolution&mdash;evolution
on a new and higher plane though, indeed,
underlaid and conditioned by the laws of organic evolution.
As <i>external physical</i> Nature uses many factors to
carry forward organic evolution, so the <i>internal spiritual</i>
nature, characteristic of man alone, uses these same factors
in a new way to carry forward human evolution or
progress. Thus, for example, one organic factor&mdash;the environment&mdash;is
modified or even totally changed so as to
effect suitably the human organism. This is <i>hygiene</i>.
Again, use and disuse&mdash;another factor&mdash;is similarly transformed.
The various organs of the body and faculties of the
mind are deliberately used in such wise and degree (determined
by reason) as to produce the highest efficiency of
each part and the greatest strength and beauty of the whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
This is <i>education</i>&mdash;physical, mental, moral. So also the
selective factors are similarly transformed, and <i>natural</i>
selection becomes <i>rational</i> selection. We all know how
this method is applied to domestic animals and cultivated
plants in the formation of useful or beautiful varieties.
Why should it not be applied also to the improvement of
our race in the selection of our mates in marriage, or in
the selection of our teachers, our law-makers, our rulers?
Alas! how little even yet does reason control our selection
in these matters! How largely are we yet under the
law of organic evolution!</p>

<p><i>Application of these principles to some questions of
the day</i>:</p>

<p>I. Evolution, as a law of derivation of organic forms
from previous forms by descent with modifications, as
already shown, is as certain as the law of gravitation.
This question has passed beyond the realm of doubtful
discussion; but the causes, the factors, the details of the
process of evolution are still under discussion. Both
Darwin and Spencer, the two great founders of the
theory of evolution in its modern form, acknowledge
and insist on at least four factors, viz., the two Lamarckian
and the two distinctively Darwinian. The
only difference between them is in the relative importance
of the two sets: Spencer regarding the former and
Darwin the latter as the more potent. But in these
latest times there has arisen a class of biologists, including
some of highest rank, such as Wallace, Weismann,
and Lankester, who out-Darwin Darwin himself in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
exaltation of the most distinctive Darwinian factor, viz.,
natural selection. They try to show that natural selection
is the sole and sufficient cause of evolution; that
changes in the individual, whether as the effect of the
environment or by use and disuse of organs, are not inherited
at all; that Lamarck was wholly wrong; that
Darwin (in connection with Wallace) was the sole founder
of the true theory of evolution; and, finally, that Darwin
himself was wrong only in making any terms whatever
with Lamarck. This view has been called <i>Neo-Darwinism</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reasons for this view have been most
strongly put by Weismann, and are based partly on experiments,
but mainly on his ingenious and now celebrated
theory of the immortality of germ-plasm. The animal
body consists of two kinds of cells wholly different in
function&mdash;somatic cells and germ-cells, including in this
last the sexual elements both male and female. Somatic
cells are specially modified for the various functions of
the body; germ-cells are wholly unmodified. The somatic
cells are for the conservation of the <i>individual</i> life,
the germ-cells for the conservation of the <i>species</i>. In the
development of the egg the germ-cell multiplies itself
into a cell-aggregate, and then most of the resulting multitude
of cells are modified in various ways to form the
tissues and organs of the body&mdash;somatic cells; but a few
are reserved and put aside in an unmodified form in the
sexual organs as germ-cells, to again produce ova which
again divide into somatic and germ-cells, and so on indefinitely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Now, according to Weismann, inheritance is
only through <i>germ-cells</i>, while the environment affects
only the <i>somatic cells</i>. Therefore changes produced by
the environment can not be inherited. Sexual modes of
generation were introduced for the purpose of producing
variability in progeny, and thus furnishing material for
natural selection, as this was the only means of evolutionary
advance. Weismann made many experiments on
animals, especially by mutilation, to show that somatic
changes are not inherited.</p>

<p>A full discussion of this question would be unsuitable
in a work like this. We will therefore content ourselves
with making three brief remarks:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> If the views presented in the early part of this
chapter are true, then the Lamarckian factors must be
true factors, <i>because there was a time when there were no
others</i>. They were therefore necessary, at least to start
the process, even if no longer necessary at present.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> But if these factors were ever operative, <i>they must
be so still</i>, though possibly in a subordinate degree. A
lower factor is not abolished, but only becomes subordinate
to a higher when the latter is introduced. Thus it
may well be that Lamarckian factors are comparatively
feeble at the present time and among living species,
especially of the higher animals, and yet not absent altogether.
In the earliest stages of evolution there was a
<i>complete identification of germ-cells and somatic cells</i>&mdash;of
the individual with the species. In such cases, of course,
any effect of the environment must be inherited and increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
from generation to generation. But the differentiation
of the germ and somatic cells was not all at once,
nor is their sympathetic relation completely severed. It
was a <i>gradual process</i>, and therefore the effect of the
environment <i>on the germ-cells through the somatic cells</i>
continued, though in decreasing degree, and still continues.
The differentiation in the higher animals is now
so complete that germ-cells are probably not at all affected
by changes in somatic cells, unless these changes
are <i>long continued in the same direction, and are not
antagonized by natural selection</i>.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> It is a general principle of evolution that the <i>law
of the whole is repeated with modifications in the part</i>.
This is a necessary consequence of the unity of Nature.
We ought to expect, therefore, and do find, that the order
of the use of the factors of evolution is the same in the
evolution of the <i>organic kingdom</i>, in the evolution of
<i>each species</i>, and in the evolution of <i>each individual</i>. In
all these the physical factors are at first powerfully operative;
these become subordinate to organic factors, and
these, in their turn, to psychical and rational factors.
Therefore, as the individual in its early stages&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., in
embryo and infancy&mdash;is peculiarly plastic under the influence
of the physical environment, and afterward becomes
more and more independent of these; so a species when
first formed is more plastic under the influences of Lamarckian
factors, and afterward becomes more rigid to
the same. And so also the organic kingdom was at first
more plastic under Lamarckian factors, and has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
less so in the present species, especially in the higher animals.
The principal reason of this, as we have already
seen, is the increasing differentiation of germ and somatic
cells, and the removal of the former to the interior,
where they are more and more protected from external
influence.</p>

<p>II. Some evolutionists&mdash;the materialistic&mdash;insist on
making human evolution identical in all respects with
organic evolution. This, we have shown, is not true.
The very least that can be said is that a new and far
more potent factor is introduced with man, which modifies
greatly the process. But we may claim much more,
viz., that evolution is here on a different and higher
plane. The factors of organic evolution are, indeed, still
present, and condition the whole process; but they are
not left to be used by Nature alone. On the contrary,
they are used in a new way and for higher purposes&mdash;by
reason.</p>

<p>But by a revulsion from the materialistic extreme
some have gone to the opposite extreme. They would
place human progress and organic evolution in violent
antagonism, as if subject to entirely different and even
opposite laws; but we have also shown that, although the
distinctive human factor is indeed dominant, yet it is
underlaid and conditioned by all the lower factors; that
these lower factors are still necessary as the agents used
by reason.</p>

<p>III. We have already given the views of Weismann
and Wallace, and some reasons for not accepting them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
but there is one important aspect not yet touched. There
are some logical consequences of these views when applied
to human evolution which seem to us nothing less than a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. This brings into view still another
contrast between organic evolution and human progress.</p>

<p>In organic evolution, when the struggle for life is
fierce and pitiless as it is now among the higher animals,
natural selection is undoubtedly by far the most potent
factor. It is at least conceivable (though not probable)
that at the present time organic evolution might be carried
on mainly or even wholly by this factor alone; but
in human evolution, especially in civilized communities,
this is impossible. If Weismann and Wallace be right,
then alas for all our hopes of race improvement&mdash;physical,
mental, and moral!&mdash;for natural selection will never
be applied by man to himself as it is by Nature to organisms.
His spiritual nature forbids. Reason may freely
use the Lamarckian factors of environment and of use
and disuse, but is debarred the unscrupulous use of natural
selection <i>as its only method</i>. As this is an important
point, we must explain.</p>

<p>All enlightened schemes of physical culture and hygiene,
although directed primarily to secure the strength,
the health, and the happiness of the <i>present generation</i>,
yet are sustained and ennobled by the conviction that the
improvement of the individuals of each generation enters
by inheritance into the gradual physical improvement of
the race. All our schemes of education, intellectual and
moral, though certainly intended mainly for the improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of the individual, are glorified by the hope that the
race also is thereby gradually elevated. It is true that
these hopes are usually extravagant; it is true that the
<i>whole</i> improvement of one generation is not carried over
by inheritance into the next; it is true, therefore, that we
can not by education raise a lower race up to the plane of
a higher in a few generations or even in a few centuries:
but there must be at least a small residuum, be it ever so
small, carried forward from each generation to the next,
which, accumulating from age to age, determines the slow
evolution of the race. Such are the hopes on which all
noble efforts for race-improvement are founded. Are all
these hopes baseless? They are so if Weismann and
Wallace are right. If it be true that reason must direct
the course of human progress, and if it be true also that
selection of the fittest in the organic sense is the only
method which can be used by reason, then the dreadful
law of pitiless destruction of the weak, the helpless, the
sick, the old, must with Spartan firmness be voluntarily
and deliberately carried out. Against such a course we
instinctively revolt with horror, because contrary to the
law of our spiritual nature.</p>

<p>But the use by reason of the Lamarckian factors is
not attended with any such revolting consequences. All
our hopes of race-improvement, therefore, are strictly conditioned
on the efficacy of these factors&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., on the fact
that useful changes, determined by education in each generation,
are to some extent inherited and accumulated in
the race.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPECIAL PROOFS, TAKEN FROM THE GENERAL LAWS OF
ANIMAL STRUCTURE, OR FROM COMPARISON IN
THE TAXONOMIC SERIES.</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>General Principles.</i></span></h2>

<p><b>Analogy and Homology.</b>&mdash;In biology those organs or
parts in different animals are said to be <i>analogous</i> which,
however different their origin, have a general similarity
of form and especially of function; while those are called
<i>homologous</i> which, however different their general appearance,
and however different their function, yet may,
by close examination and extensive comparison, be shown
to be modifications of one another&mdash;to be, in fact, originally
the same part modified for different purposes. In
the former the parts compared look and behave as if they
were the same, but are not; in the latter they look and
behave entirely differently, but are, in fact, the same
part in disguise.</p>

<p>We can best make this plain by examples. The wing
of a bird and the wing of a butterfly are analogous organs.
They have the same function&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., flying; and
this function necessitates the same general form of a flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
plane. But they are not at all homologous; they are not
at all the same organ or part. They certainly have never
been formed one out of the other by modification. But
the wing of a bird, the fore-paw of a reptile or mammal,
the wing of a bat, and the arm and hand of a man,
though so different in form and function, are homologous
parts. On close examination they are found to have the
same general structure, to be composed of essentially the
same pieces, although they are so greatly modified in order
to adapt them to different functions, that the general
or superficial resemblance is now lost. Their structure is
precisely such as it would be if they had all originated
from some archetypal fore-limb by modifications in different
directions of its several parts. By extensive comparison
in the taxonomic and ontogenic series, all the
intermediate gradations between these extreme modifications
may be picked up.</p>

<div id="Fig_2" class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;"><img src="images/fig-02.jpg" width="423" height="93" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Lepidosiren.</div></div>

<p>Another example. The lungs of a mammal and the
gills of a fish are analogous organs, since they have the
same function of aëration of the blood. But they are
not at all homologous: they are not built on the same
plan; by no effort of the mind can we imagine that the
former could have come out of the latter by modification.
On the contrary, we have positive proof that it
did not so come. But there is an organ in the fish which
is homologous with the mammalian lung, viz., the air-bladder,
or swim-bladder. We know it&mdash;1. Because we
can trace in the taxonomic series all the gradations from
the one to the other. In most fishes the air-bladder is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
wholly cut off from the gullet, and only very feebly supplied
with blood. It is used and can be used only for
flotation. In others, as the gar-pike, the swim-bladder
is quite vascular and opens by a tube into the throat.
Through this opening air is gulped down from time to
time into the bladder, and again from time to time expelled.
In other words, this fish supplements its gill-breathing
by an imperfect lung-breathing. We have here
the beginning of a lung. In still other fishes, viz., the
Dipnoi (<i>lepidosiren</i> and <i>ceratodus</i>, <a href="#Fig_2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>), the air-bladder
becomes a more perfect lung&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., a very vascular
sacculated sac; and there is not only an opening into
the throat, but also from the throat to the snout. In
other words, we have for the first time <i>nostrils</i>. These
fishes completely combine gill-breathing with lung-breathing.
The step from these to the lowest amphibian
reptiles is so small, that some have classed the
lepidosiren among amphibians instead of fishes. The
siredon or axolotl of New Mexico, the necturus or menobranchus
of our Northern lakes, and the siren of our
Southern swamps, have both gills and lungs, and breathe
both air and water; but the lung is very imperfect, being
only a sacculated sac, like the air-bladder of the ceratodus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
and lepidosiren. No one doubts that the air-breathing
organ of an amphibian is a true lung; yet we have
traced all the gradations between it and the air-bladder
of a fish. We conclude, therefore, that if there be any
such thing as transmutation of organic forms, the lung
of higher animals must have been formed by the process
above <span class="locked">described.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>But we know it still more certainly&mdash;2. Because we
can trace the change from the one to the other in the ontogenic
series. In the life-history of the individual we
can actually see the one thing change into the other. The
frog, as is well known, when first hatched, is a tadpole.
It has no legs, but locomotes by means of a vertically-expanded
tail. It has no lungs, but breathes water instead
of air, by means of gills. It is in all respects,
therefore, a fish, and would be classed as such if it remained
in this condition. But it does not; it gradually
loses its tail and gills, and acquires legs and lungs, and
breathes air only. Now in this change whence came the
lungs? From the gills by modification? No; but
from an organ similar in character and position to the
air-bladder of a ceratodus, or a lepidosiren. This organ
has gradually developed into a lung. The steps of the
change are briefly as follow: First, the breathing is
wholly water-breathing by gills. Next, by the development
of this other organ, it is partly water-breathing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
gills, and partly air-breathing by lungs. Lastly, the gills
gradually dry up, and the lungs develop more and more,
until the breathing is wholly by lungs.</p>

<p>We have dwelt somewhat upon this example, because
it is an excellent example of what we mean by homology,
and also because we will have occasion to use it again.
But so important, for all that follows in this part, is a
clear idea on the subject of homology, that it will be best
to familiarize the mind of the reader with it by means
of a few examples drawn from plants.</p>

<p>A potato is analogous to a root&mdash;a tuberous root like
that of a dahlia or a sweet-potato&mdash;but is not at all homologous
with these. On the contrary, it is homologous
with a stem. It is essentially an underground, leafless
branch, which has thickened enormously at the point by
accumulation of starch. The evidence of this is found
in the fact that it has rudimentary leaves (scales) arranged
in regular spiral order of phylotaxis, each with
its axillary bud (eyes). It is still more clearly shown by
the fact that buds above-ground which, if let alone,
would form leafy branches, may be made to become tubers
by covering them with earth or dead leaves, and
thus excluding the light; and, conversely, underground
buds which, if let alone, would form tubers, may be
made to grow into leafy branches by exposing them to
the light.</p>

<p>Take another example: The broad, flat, elliptical,
green masses so characteristic of the cactus family, and
usually called their leaves, are indeed <i>analogous</i> to leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
in color, form, and function; for they are green and
flat, and assimilate carbonic acid and water (CO<sub>2</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>O) like leaves. But they are not, in truth, leaves,
but modified stems, for they have the essential structure
of stems, with their pith, wood, medullary rays, and
bark, and may be traced through all gradations into
the ordinary cylindrical form of stems. Where are their
leaves, then? Their spines are their abortive leaves.
These are arranged spirally like leaves, and bear buds
in their axils like leaves. They are, in truth, leaves,
modified to perform the function of defensive armor;
while their function has been delegated to the stem
flattened for this purpose.</p>

<div id="Fig_3" class="figright" style="width: 439px;"><img src="images/fig-03.jpg" width="439" height="448" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang">

<span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;A branch of young acacia, showing change from one form of
leaf to the other; <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, successive stages of change; <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>, leaf
stalk which gradually changes into the blade in <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>e</i>.
</div></div>

<p>One more example: The acacias, of which there are
fifteen to twenty species in California, introduced from
Australia, form two groups having extremely different
styles of leaves. We will call them the feather-leaved
and the simple-leaved acacias. In the former, the leaves
are very finely bipinnate, and the general aspect of the
foliage is extremely feathery and graceful. In the latter
the leaves are simple, ovate, and, curiously enough, set
on edge; and the general aspect of the tree is therefore
rather stiff. It seems at first incredible that leaves so
different and aspects so diverse should belong to plants
of the same genus. But a little close examination shows
that, as usual, the botanists are right and the popular
judgment wrong. The plumose-leaf is the normal leaf-form
for this genus. The simple leaf is not only abnormal,
but in a homological sense is not a leaf at all&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
it does not correspond to the part called the <i>blade</i> in
ordinary simple leaves of other trees. In the seedling of
the simple-leaved acacias, and sometimes for a considerable
time in the young tree, the leaves are all plumose.
As the tree matures it gradually changes its dress and
puts on its <i>toga virilis</i>. The gradual change from the
one form to the other may easily be traced in the same
tree, and even often in the same branch (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
steps of the change (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>) are shown in the following
figure, drawn from nature. It is seen, by bare inspection
of the figure, that the so-called leaf, <i>d</i>, of the
simple-leaved acacias, is really the vertically-expanded
leaf-stalk, <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>, the true leaf or blade being wholly aborted.
The whole structure of this so-called leaf is different
from that of a true blade. For example, its style of ribbing
is parallel, its position is edgewise to the sky, its
palisade cells are on both sides alike, etc. To emphasize
this difference, botanists call such an apparent leaf a
<i>phyllodium</i>, or phyllode.</p>

<p>After these illustrations we now repeat the definitions
in different words. Analogy has reference to
<i>general resemblance</i> of form determined by <i>similarity
of function</i>, however different the origins of the parts
compared may be. Homology has reference to <i>community
of origin</i>, however obscured to the superficial
observer such common origin may be by modifications
necessary to adapt to different functions. Observe,
then, there are two ideas here which must be kept
distinct. One is common origin, always shown by
deep-lying, essential identity of structure; the other
is adaptive modification for function. Organs of the
most diverse origin may resemble by adaptive modification
for the same function. This is analogy. Organs
of the same origin may assume very different
appearance by adaptive modifications for different functions.
This is homology. In the latter case, which is
the one that concerns us, a profound study of essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
structure and structural relations to other parts, and
especially extensive comparison in the taxonomic and
ontogenic series, will usually detect the homology, or
common origin, in spite of the obscurations produced by
adaptive modifications. It is seen, also, that analogy is
a superficial resemblance, easily detected by the popular
eye, and therefore embodied in popular language; while
homology is a deep-seated and essential resemblance,
detected often only by profound study and extensive
comparison. Now, one of the strongest proofs of the
truth of evolution is taken from the homologies of animal
structure. Common origin completely explains
homology. Every other explanation is transcendental,
and therefore unscientific.</p>

<p><b>Primary Divisions of the Animal Kingdom.</b>&mdash;Now,
the animal kingdom consists of several primary divisions,
called sub-kingdoms or departments. The animals in
these groups differ so essentially from one another in their
<i>plan of structure</i>, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to
trace any structural relation between them&mdash;to imagine
how the members of one could have been derived from
those of another&mdash;or conceive the common stem from
which they all separated. In other words, it is impossible,
in the present state of knowledge, to trace homology
with any certainty from one group to another.
But within the limits of each primary group
the homology is easy. Some naturalists&mdash;Agassiz and
Cuvier&mdash;have made four or five of these primary groups.
Some&mdash;Huxley&mdash;have made eight. Some make nine or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
<span class="locked">ten.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> We will not trouble ourselves to settle this question;
for all agree to make <i>vertebrata</i> and <i>articulata</i> or
<i>arthropoda</i> two of them, and all our illustrations will be
drawn from these. Other groups are too unfamiliar to
the general reader to serve our purpose.</p>

<p>Now, as already stated, homology can not be traced
with any certainty between the primary groups, but
within the limits of each group it may be traced with
ease and beauty. Analogy, however, being connected
with function, and function being universal, can be
traced throughout the animal kingdom. While, therefore,
it is probable, nay, almost certain, that all animals
have had a common origin, we can not yet trace these
great departments by homology to that common origin.
But the common origin of each department is quite clear.
For example, the structure of all vertebrate animals is
precisely such as would be the case if all came from one
primal vertebrate, variously modified to adapt to various
modes of life. Also, the structure of all arthropods
is precisely such as would be if all came from one primal
arthropod, which, from generation to generation, became
gradually modified in different directions, in order
to adapt itself to various modes of life. But between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
arthropods and vertebrates we can not yet clearly see a
common origin, although there doubtless was such.</p>

<p>These great departments may, therefore, be compared
to <i>natural styles of animal architecture</i>. As there are
various styles of human architecture&mdash;Oriental, Egyptian,
Greek, Gothic&mdash;each of which may be variously
modified to adapt it to all the different purposes for
which buildings are made, without destroying, though
perhaps obscuring, the integrity of the style; so the different
primary groups or departments may be regarded
as different styles of animal structure, each of which
may be and has been modified in many ways to adapt it
to various habits and modes of life, obscuring but not
destroying the general style. Or they may be compared
to natural <i>machines</i>. As a steam-engine, by modification,
may be adapted to many kinds of purposes, obscuring,
perhaps, but not destroying the essential identity of
structure; even so the vertebrate machine by modification
may be, and has been, adapted to many kinds of
purposes, and thus become a swimming-machine, a
crawling-machine, a flying-machine, a running-and leaping-machine,
without destroying, although obscuring,
the essential identity of structure. As in architecture,
æsthetic principles of form may be traced through each
style, but not from style to style, while the mechanical
principles of construction run through all alike; so
also in animal architecture, the laws of form and styles
of structure are traceable with ease only within the
limits of each primary group, while the laws of function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
are traceable through all groups alike. Or, again, and
finally: Each of these departments may be compared to
a <i>tree</i>, with branches, twigs, and spray, all obviously
coming from one common stem, but each stem seems
separate. They are, indeed, probably, themselves only
great branches of one common trunk, but their connection
is too remote and obscure to be made out clearly by
means of homology. Other evidences, however, drawn
from other sources, as we shall see hereafter, are not
wholly wanting.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_II_V" id="CHAPTER_II_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="subhead">PROOFS FROM HOMOLOGIES OF THE VERTEBRATE
SKELETON.</span></h2>

<p>The proposition to be established here is, that all vertebrates
have not only a common general plan of structure,
but an essential identity even in detail, although
this identity is obscured by adaptive modifications. We
will try to show first a common general plan, and then,
taking parts most familiar to the general reader, will
show essential identity even in detail.</p>

<p><b>Common General Plan.</b>&mdash;1. All vertebrate animals, and
none other, have an <i>internal</i> jointed skeleton worked by
muscles on the <i>outside</i>. As we shall see hereafter, the
relation of skeleton and muscle in arthropods is exactly
the reverse.</p>

<p>2. In all vertebrates, and in none other, the axis of
this skeleton is a jointed backbone (vertebral column)
inclosing and protecting the nervous centers (cerebro-spinal
axis). These, therefore, may well be called back-boned
animals.</p>

<p>3. All vertebrates, and none other, have a number of
their anterior vertebral joints enlarged and consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
into a box to form the <span class="locked">skull,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> in order to inclose and protect
a similar enlargement of the nervous center, viz., the
brain; and also usually, but not always, a number of posterior
joints, enlarged and consolidated to form the pelvis,
to serve as a firm support to the hind-limbs.</p>

<p>4. All vertebrates, and none other, have two cavities,
inclosed and protected by the skeleton, viz., the neural
cavity above, and the visceral or body cavity below, the
vertebral column; so that a cross-section of the body is
diagrammatically represented by <a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

<div id="Fig_4" class="figleft" style="width: 153px;"><img src="images/fig-04.jpg" width="153" height="242" alt="" />

showing the relation of skeleton to the cavities. <i>n</i>,&nbsp;neutral cavity;
<i>v</i>,&nbsp;visceral cavity; <i>c</i>,&nbsp;centrum of vertebra.
</div></div>

<p>5. All vertebrates, with few exceptions,
and no other animals, have
two and only two pair of limbs.
The exceptions are of two kinds,
viz.: <i>a</i>, some lowest fishes, amphioxus
and lampreys, which probably
represent the vertebrate condition
before limbs were acquired; and <i>b</i>,
degenerate forms like snakes and
some lizards, which have lost their
limbs by disuse.</p>

<p>So much concerns the general
plan of skeletal structures, and is
strongly suggestive of&mdash;in fact, is
inexplicable without&mdash;common origin.
But much more remains
which is not only suggestive, but demonstrative of such
origin. By extensive comparison in the taxonomic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
ontogenic series, the whole vertebrate structure in all its
details in different animals may be shown to be modifications
one of another. Sometimes a piece is enlarged,
sometimes diminished, or even becomes obsolete; sometimes
several pieces are consolidated into one; but, in spite
of all these obscurations, corresponding parts may usually
be made out. This is the main subject of this chapter.</p>

<p><b>Special Homology of Vertebrate Limbs.</b>&mdash;It would
lead us much too far into unfamiliar technicalities to
take up the whole skeleton. We select the limbs, both
because their general structure is more familiar, and because
in them the two fundamental ideas of essential
identity and of adaptive modification are both admirably
illustrated. The reason of this is, that it is by the limbs
that the organism chiefly reacts on the environment, and
is modified by it.</p>

<p><b>Fore-limbs.</b>&mdash;In the accompanying figures (<a href="#Fig_5">Figs.&nbsp;5&ndash;18</a>)
we have represented, side by side, the fore-limbs of
many vertebrates, taken from all the classes&mdash;mammals,
birds, reptiles, and fishes. For convenience of comparison,
the corresponding parts are similarly lettered in all.
Also, in order to identify easily certain important corresponding
segments, we have drawn through them a continuous
dotted line. In man, nearly all the parts are
present, and his limbs, therefore, may be taken as a term
of comparison; for man’s structure, except his brain, is
far less modified than that of many animals.</p>

<p>Note, then, the following points: 1. The collar-bone
(clavicle) is associated with wide separation of the shoulders,
and the free use of the fore-limb for prehension or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
for flight, but is gradually lost in proportion as the fore-limb
is brought nearer together and used for support,
because it is no longer wanted. I say <i>gradually</i>, for all
the steps of the passing away may be found. The useless
rudimentary condition is not uncommon.</p>

<p>2. The coracoid (<i>c</i>), it is seen, is a small, beak-like
process of the blade-bone (scapula) in man and mammals;
but in birds (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>) and reptiles (<a href="#Fig_14">Figs.&nbsp;14</a>, <a href="#Fig_18">18</a>)
it is a separate bone as large as the blade-bone itself,
jointed with the latter at the shoulder and with the
breast-bone (sternum) in front, thus making together a
strong shoulder-girdle for the attachment of the fore-limb.
This was undoubtedly the condition in the original
or earliest walking animal, viz., reptiles. It was
inherited and retained by birds, because necessary for
powerful action of the wings in flight. In mammals it
gradually dwindled and became united with the blade-bone
as a process. In one mammal, the lowest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
reptilian living&mdash;the ornithorhynchus&mdash;the coracoid is
much like that of reptiles&mdash;a large, flat bone, separated
from the blade-bone and articulated with the breast-bone.
It is a significant fact that, in the mammalian
embryo, it is first developed as a separate bone and
afterward united with the scapula.</p>

<div id="Fig_14" class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;"><img src="images/fig-14-17.jpg" width="427" height="290" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 14&ndash;17.</span>&mdash;14. Fore-limb of turtle. 15. Mole. 16. Whale. 17. Fish.</div></div>

<p>3. In man, monkeys, bears, and some other mammals,
the limb is fairly free from the body and the elbow
half-way down the limb; while in herbivores (<a href="#Fig_5">Figs.&nbsp;8,&nbsp;9</a>),
such as the horse, ox, and deer, etc., the elbow is
high on the side of the body, and the limb is free only
from the elbow downward. Perhaps in these cases most
observers do not recognize it as an elbow at all. All
gradations between these extremes are easily traced.
The free condition of the limb is evidently the original
one, the condition in herbivores being an extreme modification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
associated with another modification mentioned
under 5.</p>

<p>4. In man and in many mammals, and in all reptiles
and birds, there are two bones in the forearm (radius
and ulna). In the more specialized
forms of hoofed animals
(ungulates), such as horse and
ruminants (<a href="#Fig_5">Figs.&nbsp;8, 9</a>), there is
apparently but one. Two is the
normal and original number;
but one of them, the ulna, has
gradually become smaller and
smaller, and finally is reduced
to a short splint, and consolidated
with the radius as a process
extending backward to form
the point of the elbow. In the
horse family every step of this
reduction and consolidation may
be traced in the course of its
geological history.</p>

<div id="Fig_18" class="figcenter" style="width: 567px;"><img src="images/fig-18.jpg" width="567" height="155" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Mosasaur.</div></div>

<p>5. The <i>wrist</i> of many mammals
and all birds differs in
structure from that of man,
chiefly in containing a smaller
number of bones. The normal
number, as in man, seems to be
eight. The decrease takes place
mainly by consolidation of two or more into one. In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
cases usually the embryo will show the bones still separate,
thus revealing the ancestral condition. Again, the <i>position</i>
of the wrist is noteworthy. In man, monkeys, the
bear family, and several other mammalian families, and
in all reptiles, the hand bends forward at the wrist, so
that the tread is on the whole palm (palmigrade). But,
in all the most specialized mammals, the wrist can not
bend in this direction, and therefore this joint can not be
brought to the ground. The tread is therefore on the
toes (digitigrade), and the wrist is high up above the
ground. In the horse (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>), the ox, and many other
mammals, for example, the wrist is so high that it is
not usually recognized as a wrist, and is often called
the <i>fore-knee</i>. Now, homologous parts ought to have
the same <i>scientific</i> name; but to use the word “<i>hand</i>”
in the case of lower animals might produce confusion
and misconception. Therefore it has been agreed among
comparative anatomists to use instead the Latin word
“<i>manus</i>” for all that corresponds, in any animal, to
the hand of man&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., all from the wrist downward.
The manus of a horse is about fifteen inches long. The
manus of a pterodactyl, such as that found by Marsh
in the cretaceous strata of the West, with an expanse
of wings of twenty-five feet, was probably not less than
seven or eight feet long.</p>

<p>6. The number of palm-bones (metapodal) and toes
deserves special notice. In fishes, and in some extinct
swimming reptiles, these are or were very numerous, but
in the earliest land-animals they became five. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the number now in nearly all reptiles, and in all the
more generalized mammals. It may be called the normal
number for a walking animal. In very many mammals,
such, for example, as the dog family, they are reduced to
four, though the fifth often remains as a useless, rudimentary
splint and dew-claw (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>), thus showing the
process of dwindling in the ancestry. In hoofed animals
the process of gradual diminution is shown even
in existing forms, and still better in extinct forms.
Confining ourselves, now, only to existing forms, in the
elephant there are five palm-bones and toes, and in the
hippopotamus there are four, all functional. In the hog
(<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>) there are still four, but two are behind the
others and much smaller, and do not touch the ground&mdash;are
not functional unless in soft ground. In the cow,
deer, etc., the palm-bones are reduced to two, and these
are consolidated into <i>one</i> (canon-bone), and the toes are
reduced to two efficient and two useless rudiments. In
the sheep and the goat (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>) these useless rudiments
are dropped, and there are two only. Finally, in the
horse (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>), the <i>toes</i> are reduced to one, although the
palm-bones are still three, two of them, however, being
reduced to rudimentary splints.</p>

<p>How is it with birds? Have these also palm-bones
and fingers? Yes, in birds (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>) there are three
palm-bones and three fingers (the fourth and fifth being
wanting); one of them&mdash;the thumb&mdash;is free, and sometimes
carries a claw. In the earliest known and most
reptilian bird, the archæopteryx (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>), all the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
fingers are free, have the full number of joints, and all
of them carry claws. In the embryo of living birds the
fingers are all free, as
in the archæopteryx.</p>

<div id="Fig_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;"><img src="images/fig-19.jpg" width="536" height="217" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Restoration of Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus (after Marsh). One-seventh natural
size.</div></div>

<p>7. Observe, finally,
as an admirable illustration
of different
adaptative modifications
for the same purpose&mdash;flight&mdash;the
structure of the manus
of flying animals. In
the bat (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>), the
flat flying-plane is
made by enormous
elongation of the palm-bones
and finger-bones,
their wide separation
and the stretching of
a thin membrane between
them. In the
pterosaurs, or extinct
flying reptiles (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>),
one finger only is
greatly enlarged and
elongated, and the flying-membrane is stretched between
it and the hind-leg (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>), while the other three fingers
are free and provided with claws. If it be asked which
finger is it that is so greatly enlarged in this animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
we answer, it is the <i>little finger</i>. In birds, on the contrary,
the manus is consolidated to the last degree, to
form a strong basis for attachments for the quills which
form the flying-plane, and which are themselves extreme
modifications of the scales of reptiles. But throughout
all these extreme modifications the same essential structure
is detectable.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to dwell upon the still
greater modifications of limbs for swimming, as in the
whale (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>), the ichthyosaur, mosasaur (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>),
and the fish (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>). A careful inspection of the
figures, after what we have said, will be sufficient to
explain them. In the fish alone the upper segments of
the limb, viz., shoulder-girdle and humerus, are wanting,
not being yet introduced, and the manus is not
yet differentiated into palm-bones and fingers, and the
fingers are indefinitely multiplied. All these characters
are indications of low position in the scale of evolution.
The earliest vertebrates were fishes. Limbs were
not yet completely formed. In embryos of higher animals,
also, the outer segments are first formed.</p>

<p><b>Hind-Limbs.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_20">Figs.&nbsp;20 to 24</a> represent, in a similar
way, the hind-limbs of several animals&mdash;in this case all
mammals. As before, corresponding parts are similarly
lettered, and a dotted line is carried through certain
prominent parts, especially the knee, heel, instep, and
toes. By careful inspection the figures explain themselves.
Nevertheless, it will be well to draw special attention
to several of the more important points:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_20" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/fig-20-24.jpg" width="600" height="394" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 20&ndash;24.</span>&mdash;20. Hind-limb of man. 21. Monkey. 22. Dog. 23. Sheep. 24. Horse.</div></div>

<p>1. See, then, the position of the knee. The thigh-bone
in man, monkeys, bears, and several other families
of mammals, and all reptiles, is free from the body, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
the knee is far removed and half-way down the limb
(<a href="#Fig_20">Figs.&nbsp;20, 21</a>). This is undoubtedly the original and
normal condition of land-animals. But in all the more
highly specialized and swifter animals the knee is brought
nearer and nearer to the body, until, in the swiftest of
all, such as the ruminants and the horse (<a href="#Fig_20">Figs.&nbsp;23, 24</a>),
it is high up on the side of the body, in the middle of
what is usually called the thigh but which really includes
the thigh and the upper part of the lower leg or shank.</p>

<p>2. See, again, the position of the heel. In man,
monkey, bear, and many other mammals, and all <i>living</i>
reptiles, the heel is on the ground, the tread is on the
whole foot, plantigrade; while in all the more specialized
and agile animals, and especially in the swiftest of
all, such as the horse, the deer, etc., the heel is high in
the air, and the tread is digitigrade.</p>

<p>3. Observe, again: there are two degrees of digitigradeness.
The one we find in carnivorous or clawed
digitigrades, the other in herbivores or hoofed digitigrades.
In the one the tread is on the whole length of
the toes to the balls, as in man when he <i>tip-toes</i>; in
the other the <i>tread is on the tip of the last joint alone</i>.
All that in any animal corresponds to the foot of a
man&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., from the hamstring and heel downward&mdash;is
called, in comparative anatomy, the “<i>pes</i>.” The pes,
or foot of a horse, is eighteen inches long. It is easy
to see what spring and activity this mode of treading
gives to an animal. Think how helpless a horse would
be if he trod on the whole foot, heel down!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
4. Observe, again, the number of toes. In the process
of specialization there is a tendency for these to
become fewer and <span class="locked">stronger.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> The normal number, as
already seen, is five. All the earliest mammals, and
many orders of mammals still living, have five; but in
the most specialized orders, such as the ungulates or
hoofed animals, they were steadily reduced in number in
the course of evolution. In the elephant there are still
five, in the hippopotamus there are four, in the rhinoceros
three, in the goat two, in the horse one. Still more
the order of the dropping is regular. If an animal
have but four toes, it is usually the first, or great toe,
or thumb, that is wanting, or may be rudimentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
If, as in the rhinoceros, there are only three, then No.
5, or little toe, is also wanting, and the existing toes
are Nos. 2, 3, and 4. If an animal has only two toes,
as the goat, these are Nos. 3 and 4; and if only one,
as the horse, it is the third or middle toe. Or, to put
it more definitely: hoofed animals are divided into two
groups, even-toed (artiodactyl) and odd-toed (perissodactyl).
The even-toed may have four, as in the hippopotamus;
or two, as in the goat. The odd-toed
may have three, as in the rhinoceros; or but one, as
in the horse. Now, both of these orders came by differentiation,
far back in the Eocene Tertiary, from a
five-toed plantigrade ancestor. After dropping No. 1
(thumb or great toe) it is not yet decided, so far as number
of toes is concerned, whether the resulting four-toed
animal shall become artiodactyl or perissodactyl. If the
former, then the two side-toes (Nos. 2 and 5) become
shortened up, as in the hog; then rudimentary, as in the
ox and deer; and finally pass away entirely, as in the
goat. If, on the other hand, the four-toed animal is on
the line of perissodactyl evolution, it becomes first a
three-toed animal by dropping No. 5. Now, the two side-toes
(Nos. 2 and 4) shorten up more and more, and the
middle toe increases in size, until finally, in the modern
horse, only the greatly enlarged middle toe (No. 3) remains.
We look with wonder and admiration at the
<i>danseuse</i> pirouetting on the point of one toe. The
horse is performing this feat all the time. Yes, the
one toe of a horse has all the three joints like ours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
The coffin-bone is the last joint, and the hoof is the
nail.</p>

<p><b>Genesis of the Horse.</b>&mdash;Every step of this process on
the perissodactyl line may be traced in the history of
the genesis of the horse. The beautiful form and structure
of this animal were not made at once, but by a slow
process of integration of small changes from generation
to generation, and from epoch to epoch of the earth’s
history. The horse (as in fact did all ungulates) came
from a five-toed <i>plantigrade</i> ancestor, but we are not
able to trace the direct line of genesis quite so far. The
earliest stage that we can trace with certainty, in this
line of descent, is found in the eohippus of Marsh. This
was a small animal, no bigger than a fox, with three toes
behind and four serviceable toes in front, with an additional
fifth palm-bone (splint), and perhaps a rudimentary
fifth toe like a dew-claw. This was in early
Eocene times. Then, in later Eocene, came the orohippus,
which differs from the last chiefly in the disappearance
of the rudimentary fifth toe and splint. (See <a href="#Fig_25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>.)
Next, in the Miocene, came the mesohippus and
miohippus. These were larger animals (about the size of
a sheep), and had three serviceable toes all around; but
in the former the rudiment of a fourth splint in the fore-limb
yet remained. Then, in the Miocene, came the protohippus
and pliohippus. These were still larger animals,
being about the size of an ass. In the former the two
side-toes were shortening up and the middle toe becoming
larger. In the latter the two side-toes have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
splints. Lastly, only in the Quaternary comes the genus
<i>Equus</i>, or true horse. The size of the animal is become
greater, the middle toe stronger, the side-splints smaller;
but in the side-splints of the modern horse we have still
remaining the evidence of its three-toed ancestor.</p>

<p>Similar gradual changes may be traced in the two
leg-bones, which have gradually consolidated into one;
in the teeth, which have become progressively longer and
more complex in structure, and therefore a better grinder;
in the position of the heel and wrist, which have
become higher above-ground; in the general form, which
has become more graceful and agile; and, lastly, in the
brain, which has become progressively larger and more
complex in its convolutions&mdash;to give greater battery-power,
to make a more powerful dynamo&mdash;to work the
improved skeletal machine. See, then, how long it has
taken Nature to produce that beautiful finished article
we call the horse!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We have taken only limbs as examples of what is true
of the whole skeleton. To the superficial observer the
bodies of animals of different classes seem to differ fundamentally
in plan&mdash;to be entirely different machines,
made each for its own purposes, at once, out of hand.
Extensive comparison, on the contrary, shows them to
be the same, although the essential identity is obscured
by adaptive modifications. The simplest, in fact the
only scientific, explanation of the phenomena of vertebrate
structure is the idea of a primal vertebrate, modified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
more and more through successive generations by
the necessities of different modes of life.</p>

<p>See, then, in conclusion, the difference between man’s
mode of working and Nature’s. A man having made a
steam-engine, and desiring to use it for a different purpose
from that for which it was first designed and used,
will nearly always be compelled to add new parts not
contemplated in the original machine. Nature rarely
makes new parts&mdash;never, if she can avoid it&mdash;but, on the
contrary, adapts an old part to the new function. It is
as if Nature were not free to use any and every device to
accomplish her end, but were conditioned by her own
plans of structure; as, indeed, she must be according to
the derivation theory. For example: In early Devonian
times fishes were the only representatives of the vertebrate
type of structure. The vertebrate machine was
then a <i>swimming-machine</i>. In the course of time, when
all was ready and conditions were favorable, reptiles were
introduced. Here, then, is a new function&mdash;that of locomotion
on land. We want a <i>walking-machine</i>. Shall
we have a new organ for this new function? No: the
old swimming-organ is modified so as to adapt it for
walking. Time went on, until the middle Jurassic, and
birds were introduced. Here is a new and wonderful
function, that of flying in the air. We want a <i>flying-machine</i>.
We know how man would have done this; for
we have the result of his imagination in angels of Christian
art and griffins of Greek mythology. He would
have added wings to already existing parts, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
would have necessitated the alteration of the whole plan
of structure, both skeletal and muscular. Nature only
modifies the fore-limbs for this new purpose. If we
must have wings, we must sacrifice fore-legs. We can
not have both without violating the laws of morphology.
Finally, ages again passed, and, when time was fully ripe,
man was introduced. Now we want some part to perform
a new and still more wonderful function. We want
a <i>hand</i>, the willing and efficient servant of a rational
mind. We know, again, how man would have done this,
for we have the result in the centaurs of Greek mythology,
in which man’s chest, and arms, and head are added
to the body of a quadruped. But natural laws must not
be violated, even for man. If we want hands, we must
sacrifice feet. Again, therefore, the fore-limbs are modified
for this new and exquisite function. Thus, in the
fin of a fish, the fore-paw of a reptile or a mammal, the
wing of a bird, and the arm and hand of a man, we have
the same part, variously modified for many purposes.</p>

<p>Many other illustrations might be taken from the
skeleton and from other systems, especially the muscular
and nervous. But in the muscular system the modifications
have been so extreme that homology is much more
difficult to trace, and therefore requires more extensive
knowledge than we yet possess, and more extended comparison
than has yet been attempted. It has been traced
with some success through mammals, and probably will
be through air-breathing vertebrates&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., also through
birds, reptiles, and amphibians; but to trace it through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
fishes seems almost hopeless. In the case of the nervous
system, and especially of the brain, it is again distinct;
but this had better be taken up under another head,
viz., proofs from ontogeny, <a href="#CHAPTER_II_VI">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p>In the visceral organs homology is very plain, in fact
too plain. There is not modification enough in most
cases even to obscure it, because function is the same in
all animals. These organs do not, therefore, furnish
good illustrations of that essential identity in the midst
of adaptive modification which constitutes the argument
for the derivative origin of structure. It is the organs
of <i>animal life</i> that show this most perfectly, because it
is these that take hold on the environment and are
modified by it. There are, however, a few striking illustrations
to be found among the visceral organs, especially
the blood-system. This, however, had better also be
deferred to the chapter on ontogeny.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_II_VI" id="CHAPTER_II_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="subhead">HOMOLOGIES OF THE ARTICULATE SKELETON.</span></h2>

<p>We have taken the vertebrate skeleton first, only because
this department is most familiar. But in reality,
the most beautiful illustrations of essential identity of
structure in the midst of infinite diversity of adaptive
modification for different functions and habits of life,
and therefore of common origin from a primal form, are
found in the department of articulates. I use the old
Cuvierian department <i>articulata</i>, rather than the more
modern <i>arthropods</i>, because the former includes worms
also. Now, whether worms should be thus included with
arthropods, or deserve a whole department to themselves it
matters not for our purposes. It is generally admitted
that arthropods probably descended from marine worms.
They all have the same general plan of skeletal structure.
It will suit my purpose, therefore, to regard worms as
the lowest form of jointed animals.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have an entirely different plan of
structure&mdash;a different style of architecture and different
mechanical principles of machinery. Instead of a skeleton
within and muscles acting on the outside, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the skeleton on the outside, and muscles acting from
within. Instead of two cavities, a neural and visceral,
the skeleton forms but one cavity, in which all organs
are inclosed and protected. Instead of finding the
nerve-axis on the dorsal aspect of the body, we find it on
the ventral aspect.</p>

<div id="Fig_26" class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><img src="images/fig-26.jpg" width="375" height="265" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang">

<span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Diagram section across an arthropod, showing the inclosing
skeleton-ring and a pair of jointed appendages, <i>n</i>, nervous center;
<i>v</i>, viscera; <i>b</i>, blood system.
</div></div>

<p>Take any articulate animal, for example, a shrimp, a
centiped, or a beetle. Cut it across the body, and look
at the end (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>). We see a ring of bone (chitin) inclosing
all the organs (nervous system <i>n</i>, blood system <i>b</i>,
and visceral system <i>v</i>), and a pair of jointed appendages,
perhaps legs, on each side. Now imagine these parts
repeated in a linear series. The rings repeated make a
hollow, jointed tube or barrel, the appendages repeated
make a continuous row of appendages on each side. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
this is exactly what we actually find. The whole articulate
skeleton is ideally made up of a series of such repeated
rings and appendages, modified according to the
position in the series, and the uses to which they are
put. And then the whole articulate department is made
up of such articulate animals again modified according to
place in the scale of articulates. The modification in
the lower forms is slight, and therefore the identity of
the repeated parts is obvious; but as we go up the scale,
and the number and complexity of the functions increase,
the adaptive modification becomes greater and
greater, until finally it so obscures the essential identity,
that it requires the most extensive comparison in the
taxonomic series and in the ontogenic series, to pick up
the intermediate links and establish the fact of common
origin. In a word, whether they so originated or not, it
is certain that the structure of articulate animals is exactly
such as would be the case if all these animals were
genetically connected, and came originally from a primal
form something like one of the lower crustaceans, or,
perhaps, a marine worm.</p>

<div id="Fig_27" class="figleft" style="width: 251px;"><img src="images/fig-27.jpg" width="251" height="150" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Shrimp (Palæmonetes vulgaris).</div></div>

<p>It will be best to take an example from about the
middle of the scale, where the two elements, viz., essential
identity and adaptive modification, are somewhat
evenly balanced, and both traceable with ease and certainty.
Take, then, a cray-fish, a lobster, or a shrimp.
This animal (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>) has twenty or twenty-one rings
and pairs of jointed appendages. The rings are some
of them diminished, some of them increased in size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Sometimes several are consolidated; sometimes several
are partially or wholly aborted. The appendages are
modified in shape and
size, according to their
position, so as to make
them swimming-appendages
(swimmerets),
walking-appendages
(legs), eating-appendages
(jaws), and sense-appendages
(antennæ). For example, in the abdominal
region, or so-called tail, we have seven segments,
all being perfect movable rings, each with its pair of
jointed appendages, except the last, or <i>telson</i>. The
appendages of the first ring (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>, B) are specially
modified in the male as organs of copulation (B′). The
next four pairs are modified for swimmerets (D′) and
for use as holders of the eggs in the female. The appendages
of the sixth ring (G) are broad and paddle-shaped,
and, together with the telson or seventh ring
(H), form the powerful terminal swimmer. Going,
now, to the cephalo-thorax: in this either a large number
of segments (thirteen or fourteen) are consolidated
above to form the upper shell or carapace; or else, as
is more probable, two or three of the anterior segments
have enlarged and grown backward over, and at
the expense of the others, to form this shell. At any
rate, it is certain that the carapace is formed of the
dorsal portions of a number of segments consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
together. Below,
however, the segments
are all distinct,
and have
each its own pair
of appendages.
For example, going
forward in
this region, the
five next pairs of
appendages are
greatly enlarged
and very strong,
and serve the purpose
of locomotion.
They are
<i>walking-appendages</i>.
The next
two or three pairs
are smaller and
somewhat modified,
but not so
much as to obscure
their essential
similarity to
legs. Like legs,
they are many-jointed,
and like
legs, too, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
have gills attached to them. They are called maxillipeds,
or jaw-feet. They are used like hands to gather
food and carry it to the mouth. They are <i>gathering-appendages</i>.
Then follow three or four pairs still more
modified, and used for mastication. They are called
maxillæ and mandibles. They are <i>eating-appendages</i>.
Then follow two pairs, long, many-jointed, with the
same kind of curious hinge-joints, which we have in
the legs, undoubtedly homologous with all the others,
but used for an entirely different purpose, and specially
modified for that purpose. They are the antennæ.
They are delicate organs of touch and of hearing, for
the ear is situated in the basal joint of the anterior
pair. Last of all, there is still another pair, jointed and
movable, on the ends of which are situated the eyes.
These last three, therefore, are <i>sense-appendages</i>. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
writers make this last pair special organs, not homologous
with appendages.</p>

<p>For the sake of greater distinctness, we give the
whole series of these appendages in one of the higher
forms, viz., the prawn (Palemon, <a href="#Fig_29">Fig.&nbsp;29</a>, and in one of
the lower forms, Nebalia, <a href="#Fig_30">Fig.&nbsp;30</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_31" class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;"><img src="images/fig-31.jpg" width="441" height="279" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Vibilia, an amphibod crustacean (after Milne Edwards).</div></div>

<p>That these are really homologous parts is further
shown by the fact that in the case of other crustaceans,
such as limulus, the same appendages, i.&nbsp;e., the appendages
of the same body segments, which in the cases before
mentioned are used as feet, become swimmers, while
the appendages corresponding to jaw-feet become walkers;
and even what corresponds to antennæ or sense-appendages,
may, as in branchippus, become powerful
claspers. Finally, in all the lowest crustaceans, the
identity is evident, because all the segments and their
appendages are much alike in form and function (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><img src="images/fig-32.jpg" width="420" height="157" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Lithobius forcipatus (after Carpenter).</div></div>

<p>We have taken examples from near the middle of the
articulate scale, because, as already stated, both the essential
identity and the adaptive modifications are easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
traced. If we go downward in the scale, the structure
becomes more and more generalized, and the rings and
appendages become more and more alike (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>), until
in the most generalized forms we have only a series of
similar rings, with similar pairs of appendages, except
some necessary modifications to form the head and tail.
This is well shown in the centiped (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>), and still
better in marine worms (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>). In some marine
worms the slight modification to form the head takes
place under our very eyes. These often multiply by dividing
themselves into two. When they do so, they make
a new head and new tail by slight modification of segments
and appendages (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_33" class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;"><img src="images/fig-33.jpg" width="317" height="120" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Syllis prolifera.</div></div>

<p>If, on the other hand, we go up the scale, we find
adaptive modifications obscuring more and more the
simple and obvious identity of parts, until finally the
identity can not be recognized without extensive comparison
in the taxonomic series and study of embryonic
conditions. In crabs&mdash;which is a higher form than cray-fish&mdash;the
tail or abdomen seems to be wanting, but is only
very small and bent under the body and thus concealed.
In all essential respects the structure is precisely like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
cray-fish. In fact, in the embryo, we trace the one form
into the other; for the crab is at first a long-tailed crustacean
(<a href="#Fig_34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_34" class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;"><img src="images/fig-34.jpg" width="387" height="287" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Development of Carcinus mœnas. <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, zoæa stage; <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, megalopa
stage; <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, final state (after Couch).</div></div>

<p>Insects are the highest form of articulates. In these,
therefore, we find the modification is still greater than in
crustaceans, though even here the ring-and-appendage
structure is plain enough in most cases.</p>

<p>One of the best evidences of high grade among animals
is the gathering of the segments into distinct
groups, and especially the distinctness of the <i>head</i> as one
of these groups. In worms and lower crustaceans there
is no grouping at all, the skeleton being a continuous
series of joints, only slightly modified at the anterior
and posterior extremities. In the higher crustacea, and
in spiders and scorpions, they are grouped into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
regions, viz., cephalo-thorax and abdomen. In insects
they are grouped into three very distinct regions&mdash;head,
thorax, and abdomen. In insects, therefore, we find for
the first time the head distinctly separated from the rest
of the body. This is an evidence of high grade, because
it shows the dominance of head-functions.</p>

<div id="Fig_35" class="figright" style="width: 433px;"><img src="images/fig-35.jpg" width="433" height="600" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang">

Kingsley).
</div></div>

<p>The insect, such, for example, as a grasshopper, consists
of seventeen or eighteen segments (<a href="#Fig_35">Fig.&nbsp;35</a>). Of
these, four belong to the head, three to the thorax, and
about ten to the abdomen. Those of the abdomen are
all separated and movable; those of the thorax and head
are more or less consolidated. The appendages of the
head-segments become antennæ and jaw-parts, i.&nbsp;e., mandibles&mdash;maxillæ
and labium; the appendages of the thorac-segments
become legs (the wings are not homologous
with appendages), while those of the abdomen are aborted.
The steps of the gradual consolidation on the one hand,
and the abortion on the other, may be traced in the embryo
or larva&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., in the caterpillar or the grub of a
bee or a beetle. In the caterpillar, for example, there is
no grouping into three regions, there is no consolidation,
and all the segments have appendages. Again, the
almost infinite variety in the mouth-parts among insects,
brought about by adaptive modifications for biting,
for piercing, and for sucking, and yet the essential identity
of all to the more simple and generalized structure
of the grasshopper, is an admirable illustration of the
same principle. But to dwell upon these minor points
would carry us too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
<b>Illustration of the Law of Differentiation.</b>&mdash;We have
here, in the modifications of segments and appendages of
articulates, an admirable illustration of the most fundamental
law of evolution, viz., the law of differentiation.
As we have already seen (<a href="#Page_21">page&nbsp;21</a>), perhaps the most
beautiful and certainly the most fundamental illustration
of this law is found in the development of cell-structure.
Commencing in the lowest animals, and in
the earliest embryonic stages of the higher animals,
from a condition in which all are alike, the <i>cells</i> as we
go upward quickly diverge into different forms to produce
different tissues and perform different functions.
Here, then, we have a perfect example of essential identity
and adaptive modification. It is the very best type
of differentiation. So also skeletal <i>segments</i>, commencing,
in the lowest articulates and in earliest embryonic
stages of the higher, all alike, as we go upward in either
series, begin immediately to diverge in various directions
(divergent variation), taking different forms to subserve
different uses. Here, again, therefore, is an illustration
of the law of differentiation. Lastly, in the articulate
department, commencing with the lowest forms and earliest
embryonic conditions, and we may add earliest geological
times, and going up either series from generalized
forms very much alike, the <i>individuals</i> are gradually
differentiated into many special forms, in order to adapt
them to the diversified modes of life actually found in
nature. Thus cells, segments, individuals, are all alike
affected by this most fundamental law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
We have taken our illustrations from only the two departments
of vertebrata and articulata, because these are
the most familiar to the reader, and also have been most
carefully studied. We have shown that the general
structure of all vertebrates is precisely what it would be if
they all had come from one primal vertebrate form, and
that of all articulates what it would be if all had come
from one primal articulate form. The only <i>natural</i> explanation,
and, therefore, the only scientific explanation
of this, is that <i>they were really thus derived</i>. The same
kind of evidence may be drawn from the study of other
departments, but to pursue the subject any further in
this direction would carry us beyond the limits which
we have assigned. We desire only to explain the nature,
not to give all, of the evidence. The examples given will
be sufficient for the purposes of illustration. The whole
proof is nothing less than the whole science of comparative
anatomy.</p>

<p>Vertebrates, then, were derived from a primal vertebrate,
articulates from a primal articulate, and so for other
departments. But whence were these <i>primals</i> derived?
Are there any intermediate links between, any deeply
concealed common plan of structure underlying these
primary groups, showing a common origin? It must be
confessed that, in their <i>mature</i> condition, there seems to
be but little evidence of such. These primary groups
seem to be built on different plans, to be fundamentally
of different styles of architecture. Therefore Darwin, in
the true spirit of inductive caution&mdash;that true scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
spirit which keeps strictly within the limits of evidence&mdash;commences
with four or five distinct primal kinds,
from which by divergent variation all animals were descended.
Nevertheless, the truly scientific biologist
must ever strongly incline to believe that these also
came from some <i>primal animal</i>, and even that both
animals and plants were derived from some primal form
of <i>living thing</i>; that as, in the taxonomic series, the
animal and vegetal kingdoms in their lowest forms
merge undistinguishably into one another; as in the
ontogenic series the animal and plant germ are one,
so also in the phylogenic series the earliest organisms
were simply living things, but not distinctively animal
nor vegetal. Science, therefore, whose mission is to
trace origins as far back as possible, must ever strive to
find connecting links between the primary groups. Some
such have been supposed to have been discovered. Some
find the origin of vertebrates among the molluscoids (ascidians);
some find the origins of both vertebrates and
articulates among marine worms (annelids). This point
is still too doubtful to be dwelt upon here. It may be
that we seek in vain for such connecting links among
existing forms. It may well be that the point of separation
of these great primary groups (unless we except
vertebrates) was far lower even than these low forms.
Both phylogeny and ontogeny seem to indicate this. In
the earliest fauna known, the primordial (for if there was
life in the archæan it was not yet differentiated into a
fauna), all the great departments, except the vertebrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
seem to have been represented. In embryonic development,
too, the point of connection or even of similarity,
between the great departments, is found, as we shall see
hereafter, only in the earliest stages&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., lower down
than any but the lowest existing forms, viz., the protozoa.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROOFS FROM EMBRYOLOGY, OR COMPARISON IN THE
ONTOGENIC SERIES.</span></h2>

<p>It is a curious and most significant fact that the successive
stages of the development of the <i>individual</i> in the
higher forms of any group (ontogenic series) resemble
the stages of increasing complexity of differentiated
structure in ascending the animal scale in that group
(taxonomic series), and especially the forms and structure
of animals of that group in successive geological epochs
(phylogenic series). In other words, the individual
higher animal in embryonic development passes through
temporary stages, which are similar in many respects to
permanent or mature conditions in some of the lower
forms in the same group. To give one example for the
sake of clearness: The frog, in its early stages of embryonic
development, is essentially a fish, and if it stopped
at this stage would be so called and classed. But it does
not stop; for this is a temporary stage, not a permanent
condition. It passes through the fish stage and through
several other temporary stages, which we shall explain
hereafter, and onward to the highest condition attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
by amphibians. Now, if we could trace perfectly the
successive forms of amphibians, back through the geological
epochs to their origin in the Carboniferous, the
resemblance of this series to the stages of the development
of a frog would doubtless be still closer. Surely
this fact, if it be a fact, is wholly inexplicable except by
the theory of derivation or evolution. The embryo of a
higher animal of any group passes <i>now</i> through stages
represented by lower forms, because in its evolution (phylogeny)
its ancestors <i>did actually have these forms</i>. From
this point of view the ontogenic series (individual history)
is a brief recapitulation, as it were, from memory,
of the main points of the philogenic series, or family history.
We say brief recapitulation of the <i>main</i> points,
because many minor points are dropped out. Even some
main points of the earliest stages of the family history
may be dropped out of this sort of inherited memory.</p>

<p>This resemblance between the three series must not,
however, be exaggerated. Not only are many steps of
phylogeny, especially in its early stages, dropped out in
the ontogeny, but, of course, many adaptive modifications
for the peculiar conditions of embryonic life are
added. But it is remarkable how even these&mdash;for example
the umbilical cord and placenta of the mammalian
embryo&mdash;are often only modifications of egg-organs of
lower animals, and not wholly new additions. It is the
similarity in spite of adaptive modifications that shows
the family history.</p>

<p>We will now illustrate by a few striking examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
We can not do better than to take, again, as our first
example, the development of tailless amphibians, and
dwell a little more upon it:</p>

<p><b>1. Ontogeny of Tailless Amphibians.</b>&mdash;It is well
known that the embryo or larva of a frog or toad, when
first hatched, is a legless, tail-swimming, water-breathing,
gill-breathing animal. It is essentially a fish, and would
be so classed if it remained in this condition. The fish
retains permanently this form, but the frog passes on.
Next, it forms first one pair and then another pair of
legs; and meanwhile it begins to breathe also by lungs.
At this stage it breathes equally by lungs and by gills;
i.&nbsp;e., both air and water. Now, the lower forms of amphibians,
such as siredon, menobranchus, siren, etc., retain
permanently this form, and are therefore called
<i>perennibranchs</i>, but the frog still passes on. Then the
gills gradually dry up as the lungs develop, and they now
breathe wholly by lungs, but still retain the tail. Now
this is the permanent, mature condition of many amphibians,
such as the triton, the salamander, etc., which are
therefore called <i>caducibranchs</i>, but the frog still passes on.
Finally, it loses the tail, or rather its tail is absorbed and
its material used in further development, and it becomes
a perfect frog, the highest order (<i>anoura</i>) of this class.</p>

<p>Thus, then, in ontogeny the fish goes no further than
the fish stages. The perennibranch passes through the
fish stage to the perennibranch amphibian. The caducibranch
takes first the fish-form, then the perennibranch-form,
and finally the caducibranch-form, but goes no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
further. Last, the anoura takes first the fish-form, then
that of the perennibranch, then that of the caducibranch,
and finally becomes anoura. This is shown in
the diagram, which must be read upward, line by line.</p>

</div>

<div class="caption">Diagram showing the stages of development of amphibians. (To be read
upward.)</div></div>

<p>Now, this is undoubtedly the order of succession of
forms in geological times&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., in the phylogenic series.
This series is indicated by the arrows in the diagram.
Fishes first appeared in the Devonian and Upper Silurian
in very reptilian or rather amphibian forms. Then in
the Carboniferous, fishes still continuing, there appeared
the lowest&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., most fish-like&mdash;forms of amphibians.
<i>These were undoubtedly perennibranchs.</i> In the Permian
and Triassic higher forms appeared, which were certainly
caducibranch. Finally, only in the Tertiary, so far
as we yet know, do the highest form (anoura) appear.
The general similarity of the three series is complete.
If we read the diagram horizontally, we have the ontogenic
series; if diagonally with the arrows, we have both
the taxonomic and the phylogenic series.</p>

<p><b>2. Aortic Arches.</b>&mdash;But some will, perhaps, say that
these stages in the ontogeny are only examples of adaptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
modifications&mdash;like modifications for like conditions
of life&mdash;and had better be accounted for in this way,
without reference to family history. We will, therefore,
take another example, which can not be thus accounted
for&mdash;an example in which there is no possible use <i>now</i>
for the peculiar form or structure which we find. For
this purpose we take the
case of the <i>course of circulation
in vertebrates</i>.</p>

<div id="Fig_36" class="figleft" style="width: 218px;"><img src="images/fig-36.jpg" width="218" height="414" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Showing heart and outgoing blood-vessels of a lizard

(after Owen); <span class="smcap smaller">H</span>, the heart.</div></div>

<p>If one examines the large
vessels <i>going out</i> from the
heart of a lizard, he will find
<i>six aortic arches</i>&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
three on each side. These
all unite below to form the
one descending abdominal
aorta. This is shown in the
accompanying figure (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>),
in which <i>a a′ a″</i> and
<i>b b′ b″</i> are the six arches.
Now, there is no conceivable
use in having so many
aortic arches. We know
this, because there is but
one in birds and mammals,
and the circulation is as
effective, nay, much more effective in these than in
reptiles. The explanation of this anomaly is revealed
at once as soon as we examine the circulation of a <i>fish</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
which is shown in the accompanying figure (<a href="#Fig_37">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>).
The multiplication of the aortic arches is here, of
course, necessary, for they are the <i>gill-arches</i>. The
whole of the blood passes through these arches, to be
aërated in the gill-fringes. The use of this peculiar
structure is here obvious enough. If a lizard were ever
a fish, and afterward turned into a lizard, changing its
gill-respiration for lung-respiration, then, of course, the
useless gill-arches would remain to tell the story. Now,
although a lizard never was a fish, in its <i>individual</i> history
or ontogeny, it was a fish in its family history or
phylogeny, and therefore it yet retains, by heredity, this
curious and <i>useless</i> structure as evidence of its ancestry.</p>

<div id="Fig_38" class="figright" style="width: 426px;"><img src="images/fig-38.jpg" width="426" height="221" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></div></div>

<i>c c</i>, connecting branches in the tadpole; <i>p p</i>, pulmonary branches.
</div></div>

<p>That this is the true explanation is demonstrated by
the fact that in amphibians this very change actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
takes place before our eyes in the <i>individual history</i>. We
have already seen that the individual frog, in its tadpole
state, is a gill-breather. It has therefore its gill-arches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>), three on each side, like a fish, and for the same
reason, viz., the aëration of the blood. But when its gills
dry up and lung-respiration is established, its now useless
gill-arches still remain as aortic arches, to attest their
previous condition (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>). Now, the lizard undoubtedly
came from an air-breathing, tailed amphibian, and
therefore inherited this form of arterial distribution. In
both lizard and amphibian the ultimate cause is an origin
from fishes, in which such arches are obviously necessary.
The diagrams, <a href="#Fig_38">Figs.&nbsp;38</a> and <a href="#Fig_39">39</a>, are illustrations somewhat
idealized, showing the manner in which the change
actually takes place in air-breathing amphibians. <a href="#Fig_38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a> represents the tadpole stage, and <a href="#Fig_39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a> the mature
condition. In the former the gills are mostly external,
G G′, etc., but also internal, <i>g g′</i>, as in the fish. Observe
in this condition the small connecting vessels, <i>c c′</i>. When
the external gills dry up, these are enlarged, and the
whole of the blood passes through them, as shown in
Fig. 39. It is seen, also, in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>, that a small branch,
<i>p</i>, goes from the lower gill-arches to the yet rudimentary
lung, <i>l</i>. When the gill-fringes have disappeared, the
whole of the blood of the lower arch goes through the
now enlarged pulmonary branch to the lungs, L, now in
full activity, and the remainder of this arch disappears,
as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>.</p>

<p>The change which actually took place in the family
history of the lizard probably differed from the above
only in being more simple, the gills being only internal
like the fish. The external gills complicate the process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
a little in the case of the frog, but the principle is precisely
the same.</p>

<p>As already explained (<a href="#Page_82">pages 82&ndash;85</a>), the large gap between
fishes and reptiles, as regards mode of respiration,
is completely filled both in the taxonomic series&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
in ganoids, dipnoi, and the mature condition of
the different orders of amphibians&mdash;and in the ontogeny
of the higher amphibians. Now, we add that the same
is true of the arterial distribution. We have just traced
the change in the ontogeny of the frog, but the steps of
the same change are traceable in passing from the typical
fish (teleosts), through dipnoi and amphibians to reptiles.
Thus, again, the phylogeny, the taxonomy, and
the ontogeny, are in complete accord.</p>

<p>But the argument for evolution does not stop here.
If birds and mammals have come from reptiles, and
therefore from fishes, we may expect to find some evidences
of the same kind still lingering in the great arteries.
And such we do find. It is a most curious and
significant fact that, in the early embryonic condition of
birds and mammals, including man himself, we find
on each side of the neck several gill-slits, each with its
gill-arch, and therefore <i>several aortic arches on each
side</i>, precisely similar to what we have already described.
These arches are subsequently, some of them, obliterated;
some modified to form the one aortic arch, and some
of them still more modified to form the other great arteries
coming from the heart to supply the head and forelimbs.</p>

<p>This is so beautiful and convincing an example, and
one so generally unfamiliar, to even intelligent persons,
not especially acquainted with biology, that it is best to
explain it more fully. In <a href="#Fig_40">Fig.&nbsp;40</a> we give a mammalian
heart and outgoing vessels, very slightly modified, so as
to suggest the process of change. In <a href="#Fig_41">Fig.&nbsp;41</a> we give

as they exist in the embryo of mammals, birds, and
reptiles. It represents, also, substantially, the arches as
they exist in the <i>mature</i> condition in the most reptilian
fishes (dipnoi) and in some sharks, except that in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the arches are of course furnished with gill-fringes. We
will use this figure, therefore, to represent both the embryonic

become in mammals and in man. In the bird (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig.&nbsp;42</a>)
the first pair of arches become the two pulmonary arteries
as they do also in the lizard. The second pair become on
the right side (left of
the diagram) the aortic
arch, on the left side
(right of the diagram)
the left subclavian, <i>s′c′</i>
(the right subclavian,
<i>sc</i>, is a branch of the
aortic arch). The third
pair become carotids,
<i>cc</i>, while the fourth and
fifth, as already said, are
aborted. In the mammal
(<a href="#Fig_43">Fig.&nbsp;43</a>), on the left
side (right of the diagram)
the first arch becomes
the pulmonary
artery, <i>p</i>. In the fœtus the continuation of this arch
forms the ductus arteriosus, which is afterward obliterated,
as shown in the dotted line. The second arch becomes
the aortic arch, the third the left exterior carotid.
On the right side (left of the diagram) the first arch
becomes aborted; the second, the right subclavian, <i>sc</i>
(the <i>left</i> subclavian, <i>s′c′</i>, is a branch of the aortic arch);
and the third, the right carotid. Nos. 4 and 5, on both
sides, as usual, are aborted.</p>

Mag&shy;ni&shy;fied two and one-half times.</div></div>

<p>See, then, the gradual process of
change through the whole vertebrate
department. In the lowest of all vertebrates,
if vertebrate it may be called
(for what corresponds to its backbone
is an unjointed, fibrous cord), the amphioxus
or lancelet (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>), there are
about forty gill-arches on each side.
As we rise in the scale of fishes these
are reduced in number. In the lamprey,
there are seven; in the sharks,
usually five; in ordinary fishes (teleosts),
there are four or sometimes only
three on each side, the others being
aborted. Thus far the change is only
by diminution of number in accordance
with a law universal in biology, that
decrease in the number of identical
organs is evidence of advance in the
grade of organization, provided that it
be associated with more perfect structure
of the organ. The further change
is one of adaptive modification. In
some reptiles (lizard) the three gill-arches
on each side all retain the form
of aortic arches; in some reptiles only
two retain this form. In birds and
mammals only one arch is retained, in
the form of aortic arch, the others being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
modified to form the great outgoing vessels of the
heart, or else aborted. It may be well to observe that in
birds the one aortic arch turns to the right, while in
mammals it turns to the left. This is positive evidence
that mammals could not have come from birds, nor <i>vice
versa</i>. They both came from reptiles, and, of the many
reptilian arches, a right one was retained by the bird
branch, and a left one by the mammalian.</p>

<p>In all the figures illustrating this subject, we have left
out the great <i>incoming</i> vessels or veins, because we are
not here concerned with them, they not being transformed
gill-arches.</p>

<p>Last of all, it may be well to stop a moment to show
the cogency of this evidence. If it were a question of
the origin of some structure not only useful (for all structures
selected by Nature must be useful) but the <i>best
imaginable</i>, like the eye or the ear, for example; then, if
<i>we examined only the highest form</i> or <i>the finished article</i>,
there are two ways in which it is possible to explain the
adaptive structure. We may either suppose that it was
made at once out of hand, by some intelligent contriver;
or else that it was slowly made by a process of evolution,
becoming more and more perfect by a selection of only
the most perfect from generation to generation. But in
the case of the six aortic arches of the lizard, we are shut
up to the one explanation only, viz., by slow process of
evolution. One arch is all that is necessary, as is plainly
shown by the use of only one in the more perfect circulation
of birds and mammals. If the thing were done out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of hand, unconditioned by the previous structure in
fishes, to have made six was surely but a bungling piece
of work.</p>

<p><b>3. Vertebrate Brain.</b>&mdash;Another excellent example is
the structure of the vertebrate brain. The brain of an
average fish is represented in <a href="#Fig_45">Fig.&nbsp;45</a>. It consists of four
or five swellings, or ganglia, strung along, one beyond
another. Commencing behind, these are, first, the medulla,
<i>m</i>; then the cerebellum, <i>cb</i>; then the optic lobes,
<i>ol</i>; then the cerebrum and thalamus combined, <i>cr</i>; and
last, the olfactive lobes, <i>of</i>. Of these, it will be observed,
the optic lobe is the largest in the brain of the fish (<a href="#Fig_45">Fig.&nbsp;45</a>).
In the brain of the reptile (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig.&nbsp;46</a>) we have the
same serial arrangement, of the same parts, only that the
cerebrum has now become the dominant part instead of
the optic lobes. In the average bird (<a href="#Fig_47">Fig.&nbsp;47</a>) the cerebrum
has grown so large that it extends backward, and
partly covers the optic lobes. In the lower mammals
(marsupials), the brain is much the same in this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
as in birds&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the cerebrum only partly covers the
optic lobes, so that, looked at from above, the whole series
of ganglia are still visible. But in the average mammal
(<a href="#Fig_48">Fig.&nbsp;48</a>) the cerebrum is so enlarged that it covers
entirely the optic lobes and encroaches on the cerebellum
behind and the olfactive lobes in front. In some monkeys,
indeed, the cerebellum is nearly or even quite
covered. Finally, in man (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig.&nbsp;49</a>), the cerebrum has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
grown so enormously that it covers every other part and
completely conceals them from view when the brain is
looked at from above. In front it not only covers but
has grown far beyond the olfactive lobes; behind it extends
beyond and overhangs the cerebellum; on the
sides it overhangs and
covers all. Looked at
from above, nothing is
seen but this great
ganglion. The ideal
section (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig.&nbsp;50</a>) represents
all these stages
diagrammatically in
one figure. After what has been said, the figure will
be readily understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>Now, it is a most remarkable fact that substantially
these same stages, which are permanent conditions in the
taxonomic series, are passed through as transient stages in
the embryonic development of the human brain, and in
the order given above. The very early condition of the
human brain is represented in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig.&nbsp;51</a>. It is evidently
nothing more than the intercranial continuation of the
spinal cord, enlarged a little into three swellings or ganglia.
These are the early representatives of the medulla,
the optic lobes, and the thalamus; which last may
be regarded as the basal and most fundamental part of
the cerebrum. This stage may be regarded as lower
than that of the ordinary fish. I have called it, therefore,
the <i>sub-fish stage</i>. The cerebellum is a subsequent outgrowth
from the medulla, as is the cerebrum and olfactive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
lobes from the thalamus. <a href="#Fig_52">Fig.&nbsp;52</a> may be said, therefore,
to represent fairly the fish-stage. Henceforward the
principal growth is in the cerebrum and cerebellum,
both of which are subsequent outgrowths of the original
simple ganglia, the medulla, and the thalamus. The
cerebrum especially increases steadily in relative size, first
becoming larger than but not covering the optic lobes
(<a href="#Fig_53">Fig.&nbsp;53</a>). This represents the reptilian stage. Next, by
further growth, it covers partly the optic lobes (<a href="#Fig_54">Fig.&nbsp;54</a>).
This may be called the bird-stage. Then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
covers wholly the optic lobes, and encroaches on the
cerebellum behind and olfactive lobes in front (<a href="#Fig_55">Fig.&nbsp;55</a>).
This is the mammalian stage. Finally, it covers and
overhangs all, and thus assumes the human stage (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig.&nbsp;56</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_54" class="figcenter" style="width: 313px;"><img src="images/fig-54.jpg" width="313" height="169" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;Bird-stage. <i>of</i>, olfactive lobe; <i>cr</i>, cerebrum; <i>th</i>, thalamus;

<p>We have spoken thus far only of relative <i>size</i>; but
progressive changes take place also in complexity of
structure&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., in the depth and number of convolutions
of the cerebrum and cerebellum. The cerebrums
of fish, of reptile, bird, and lower mammals are smooth.
About the middle of the mammalian series it begins to
be convoluted. These convolutions become deeper and
more numerous as we go upward in the scale, until they
reach the highest degree in the human brain. The object
of these inequalities is to increase the surface of gray
matter&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the extent of the force-generating as compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
with the force-transmitting part of the brain, or
battery as compared with conducting-wire. Now, in
embryonic development the human brain passes also
through these stages of increasing complexity of organization.
Here also the ontogenic is similar to the taxonomic
series.</p>

<p>Now, why should this peculiar order be observed in
the building of the individual brain? We find the answer,
the only conceivable scientific answer to this question,
in the fact that <i>this is the order of the building of
the vertebrate brain by evolution</i> throughout geological
history. We have already seen that fishes were the only
vertebrates living in the Devonian times. The first form
of brain, therefore, was that characteristic of that class.
Then reptiles were introduced; then birds and marsupials;
then true mammals; and, lastly, man. The different
styles of brains characteristic of these classes were,
therefore, successively made by evolution from earlier
and simpler forms. In phylogeny this order was observed
because these successive forms were necessary for
perfect adaptation to the environment at each step. In
taxonomy we find the same order, because, as already explained
(<a href="#Page_11">page&nbsp;11</a>), every stage of advance in phylogeny
is still represented in existing forms. In ontogeny we
have still the same order, because ancestral characteristics
are inherited, and family history recapitulated in
the individual history.</p>

<p>But not only is this order found in the evolution
of the whole vertebrate department, but something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the same kind is found also in the evolution of <i>each
class</i>. The earliest reptiles, the earliest birds, and the
earliest mammals had smaller and less perfectly organized
brains than their nearest congeners of the present
day. This is shown in the accompanying figures (<a href="#Fig_57">Figs.&nbsp;57</a>
and <a href="#Fig_58">58</a>). To carry out one example more perfectly:
In the history of the
horse family, in connection
with the changes
of skeletal structure
already described (<a href="#Page_108">page&nbsp;108</a>),
we have also corresponding
changes in
the size and structure
of the brain; <i>pari passu</i>
with the improvement
of the mechanism
we have also increased
engine-power
and increased muscular
energy and therefore
increased activity
and grace. The brain
of a modern horse,
though not very large,
is remarkable for the
complexity of its convolutions.
The great energy, activity, and nervous excitability
of the horse are the result of this structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
<b>Cephalization.</b>&mdash;Thus, in going up the phylogenic,
the taxonomic, or the ontogenic series, we find a gradual
process of development headward, brainward, cerebrumward;
or, more generally, we might say that in all organic
evolution we find an increasing dominance of the
higher over the lower, and of the highest over all. For
example, in the lowest plane of either series we find first
the different systems imperfectly or not at all differentiated.
Then, as differentiation of these progress, we
find an increased dominance of the highest system&mdash;the
<i>nervous system</i>; then in the nervous system, the increasing
dominance of its highest part&mdash;the <i>brain</i>;
then in the brain the increasing dominance of its highest
ganglion&mdash;the <i>cerebrum</i>; and, lastly, in the cerebrum
the increasing dominance of its highest substance&mdash;the
exterior gray matter&mdash;as shown by the increasing
number and depth of the convolutions. This
whole process may be called <i>cephalization</i>.</p>

<p>Shall the process stop here? When evolution is
transferred from the animal to the human plane, from
the physiological to the psychical, from the involuntary
and necessary to the voluntary and free, shall not the
same law hold good? Yes! all social evolution, all
culture, all education, whether of the race or the individual,
must follow the same law. All <i>psychical advance
is a cephalization</i>&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., an increasing dominance
of the higher over the lower and of the highest over
all; of the mind over the body, and in the mind of
the higher faculties over the lower; and, finally, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
subordination of the whole to
the highest moral purpose.</p>

<p><b>4. Fish-Tails.</b>&mdash;Still another
and last example: It
has long been noticed that
there are among fishes two
styles of tail-fins. These are
the even-lobed, or homocercal
(<a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>), and the uneven-lobed,
or heterocercal (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>).
The one is characteristic
of ordinary fishes (teleosts),
the other of sharks and
some other orders. In <i>structure</i>
the difference is even
more fundamental than in <i>form</i>. In the former style
the backbone stops abruptly in a series of short, enlarged
joints, and thence sends off rays to form the tail-fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>); in the latter the backbone runs through
the fin to its very point, growing slenderer by degrees,
and giving off rays above and below from each joint,
but the rays on the lower side are much longer (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>,
<span class="smcap smaller">B</span>). This style of fin is, therefore, <i>vertebrated</i>, the other
<i>non-vertebrated</i>. <a href="#Fig_59">Figs.&nbsp;59</a> and <a href="#Fig_60">60</a> show these two styles
in form and structure. But there is still another style
found only in the lowest and most generalized forms of
fishes. In these the tail-fin is vertebrated and yet symmetrical.
This style is shown in <a href="#Fig_61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>.</p>

<div id="Fig_61" class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;"><img src="images/fig-61.jpg" width="334" height="181" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;Vertebrated but symmetrical fin. <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, form; <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, structure.</div></div>

<p>Now, in the development of a teleost fish (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>),
as has been shown by Alexander <span class="locked">Agassiz,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> the tail-fin is
first like <a href="#Fig_61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>; then becomes heterocercal, like <a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>;
and, finally, becomes homocercal like <a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>. Why so?
Not because there is any special advantage in this succession
of forms; for the changes take place either in the
egg or else in very early embryonic states. The answer
is found in the fact that <i>this is the order of change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
in the phylogenic series</i>. The earliest fish-tails were
either like <a href="#Fig_61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a> or <a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>; never like <a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>. The
earliest of all were almost certainly like <a href="#Fig_61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>; then
they became like <a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>; and, finally, only much later in
geological history (Jurassic or Cretaceous), they became
like <a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>. This order of change is still retained in
the embryonic development of the last introduced and
most specialized order of existing fishes. The family history
is repeated in the individual history.</p>

<div id="Fig_62" class="figleft" style="width: 335px;"><img src="images/fig-62.jpg" width="335" height="133" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;Tail of the Archæopteryx.</div></div>

<p>Similar changes have taken place in the form and
structure of birds’ tails. The earliest bird known&mdash;the
Jurassic Archæopteryx&mdash;had a long reptilian tail of
twenty-one joints, each joint bearing a feather on each
side, right and left (<a href="#Fig_62">Fig.&nbsp;62</a>). In the typical modern
bird, on the contrary, the tail-joints are diminished in
number, shortened up, and enlarged, and give out long
feathers, fan-like, to form the so-called tail (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>).
The Archæopteryx’ tail is <i>vertebrated</i>, the typical bird’s
<i>non-vertebrated</i>. This shortening up of the tail did not
take place at once, but gradually. The Cretaceous birds,
intermediate in time, had tails intermediate in structure.
The Hesperornis of Marsh had twelve joints. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
first&mdash;in Jurassic&mdash;the tail is fully a half of the whole
vertebral column. It then gradually shortens up until
it becomes the aborted
organ of typical modern
birds. Now, in
embryonic development,
the tail of the
modern typical bird
<i>passes through all
these stages</i>. At first
the tail is nearly one
half the whole vertebral column; then, as development
goes on, while the rest of the body grows, the growth of
the tail stops, and thus finally becomes the aborted organ
we now find. The ontogeny still passes through
the stages of the phylogeny. The same is true of all
tailless animals. The frog is tailed in the larval condition,
because its ancestors were tailed amphibians. Even
man himself is endowed with a much more considerable
tail, viz., eight or nine joints, in his early embryonic
<span class="locked">condition.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<p>We have taken all our examples from vertebrates,
but quite as many and as good examples might be found
among articulates. Insects, in the larval state, are
worm-like in form. Hence it is probable that the earliest
progenitors of this class were worm-like. Again,
some insects have aquatic larvæ. The progenitors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
these&mdash;in fact, of all insects&mdash;were probably aquatic.
Crabs, in a larval condition, are long-tailed, and we
know that the long-tailed crustaceans (Macrourans) preceded
the short-tailed (Brachyourans). Water-breathing
animals preceded air-breathers; the same is true in the
ontogeny of the frog, of many insects, and, we might
add, even of mammals. For the breathing of the <i>fœtus
in utero</i> is essentially by exposure of fœtal blood to the
oxygenated blood of the mother in a sort of <i>gill-fringes</i>
(placental tufts). But why should we multiply examples?
The whole of embryology, in every department,
is made up of examples of the same law.</p>

<p><b>Illustration of the Differentiation of the Whole Animal
Kingdom.</b>&mdash;Finally, the law of differentiation in the evolution
of the whole animal kingdom may be well illustrated
by means of the different directions taken in the
development of the eggs of all the various kinds of animals.
Suppose, then, we have one thousand eggs, representing
all the different departments, classes, orders,
families, etc., of animals. Many of these may doubtless
be identified by form or size, or some other superficial
character, as the eggs of this or that animal,
<i>but structurally they are all alike</i>. At first, i.&nbsp;e., as
germ-cells, they all represent the <i>earliest condition</i> of
life on the earth, and the <i>lowest forms</i> of life <i>now</i>.
If we now watch their development, we find that some
remain in this first condition without further change.
These we set aside. They are <i>Protozoa</i>. The remainder
continue to develop, but at first it would be impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to say to which of the several departments or
primary groups they each belonged. Then, by cell-multiplication,
the original single cell becomes a cell-aggregate.
It may be compared now to a compound protozoan,
such as Foraminifera. The cell-aggregate then differentiates
into layers, and forms, in fact, a two-layered
sac called a gastrula. This is the structure of some of
the lowest cœlenterates, such as the hydra. Thus far all
seem to go together. But now, for the first time, the
primary groups are declared. If it be a vertebrate, for
example, the most fundamental characters&mdash;the cerebro-spinal
axis, the vertebral column, and the double
cavity, neural and visceral, are outlined. Suppose, now,
we set aside all other departments, and fix our attention
on the vertebrates. At first we could not tell
which were mammals, birds, reptiles, or fishes; but after
a while the classes are declared. We now set aside all
other classes and watch the mammals. After a while the
order declares itself. We select the ungulates. Then
the family is declared, say the <i>Equidæ</i>; then the genus,
<i>Equus</i>; and, lastly, the species, <i>Caballus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The same would be true if we followed any other
line of development, whether in vertebrates or in any
other department. Observe, then, that, in following any
one line as we have done, there is an increasing specialization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and, if we followed all the lines, an increasing differentiation,
like the branching and rebranching of a tree.
Now, this is the type and illustration of what took place
in the development of the animal kingdom. We conclude
that the animal kingdom appeared first as Protozoa,
then as living cell-aggregates or compound protozoans,
then as gastrula or two-layered sacs with oral
opening. Then the great primary departments, unless
we except the vertebrates, commenced to separate. This
took place before the primordial period; for in the primordial
fauna we have all the departments, except vertebrates,
already declared. This completely explains why
it is that we are able to trace homology only within the
limits of each primary group.</p>

<p>But the question has doubtless already occurred to
the thoughtful reader, “Why should the steps of the
phylogeny be repeated in the ontogeny?” The general
answer is doubtless to be found in the law of heredity&mdash;that
wonderful law, so characteristic of living things.
We have compared it to a brief recapitulation from memory&mdash;the
minor points, especially if they be also early,
dropping out. But can we not explain it further? It
is probable that we find a more special explanation in
“<i>the law of acceleration</i>,” first brought forward by Prof.
Cope. By the law of heredity each generation repeats
the form and structure of the previous, and in the order
in which they successively appeared. But there is a
tendency for each successively-appearing character to appear
a little earlier in each successive generation; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
by this means time is left over for the introduction of
still higher <i>new</i> characters. Thus, characters which were
once adult are pushed back to the young, and then still
back to the embryo, and thus place and time are made
for each generation to push on still higher. The law of
acceleration is a sort of young-Americanism in the animal
kingdom. If our boys acquire knowledge and character
similar to that of adults of a few generations back,
they will have time while still young and plastic to press
forward to still higher planes.</p>

<p><b>Proofs from Rudimentary and Useless Organs.</b>&mdash;These
have to a large extent been anticipated under previous
heads. The tails of birds and the gill-arches of reptiles
are rudimentary. The finger-bones of a whale’s paddle
or a turtle’s flipper may be regarded as useless, at least
so far as the exact number of constituent pieces is concerned;
for an extended surface, without visible joints
or separate fingers, is all that is seen, and apparently all
that is required. The splint-bones of a horse’s foot or
the dew-claws of a dog’s foot are certainly useless. We
have already, in speaking of modifications of structure
and of embryonic conditions, given many examples of
this kind, but it may be well to add some striking examples
with this special point in view.</p>

<p>If different orders of existing mammals were indeed
made by gradual modification of some generalized primal
form, then it is evident that these useless remnants of
once useful parts would be most common in the most
highly modified forms. Now, of all mammals, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
whales are perhaps the most modified or changed from
the original mammalian form&mdash;so much modified, in
fact, that the popular eye scarcely recognizes them as
mammals at all. Here, then, we might expect, and do
indeed find, many examples:</p>

<p>1. The baleen whales have no teeth, and no use for
them. They have instead a wonderful armature of
fringed whalebone plates (baleen), by means of which
they gather their <span class="locked">food.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> Yet the embryo of the whale
has a full set of rudimentary teeth deeply buried in the
jawbone, and formed in the usual way characteristic of
mammalian teeth&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., by an infolding of the epithelial
surface of the gum&mdash;<i>but the teeth are never cut</i>; in fact,
they reach their highest development in mid-embryonic
life, and are again absorbed. Why, then, this waste of
developmental energy? Why should teeth be formed
only to be reabsorbed without being cut? The only conceivable
answer is, because the ancestors of the whale,
before the family of whales was fairly established, had
teeth which were gradually, from generation to generation,
aborted, because no longer used, the baleen plates
having taken their place. If whales were made at once
out of hand as we now see them, is it conceivable that
these useless teeth would have been given them?</p>

<p>2. Again, many whales have rudimentary pelvic bones,
but no hind-limbs. Why should there be pelvic bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
when the sole object of these bones is to act as a basis
for hind-limbs? In some whales, for example the right
whale, there are also rudiments of hind-legs, but these
are buried beneath the skin and flesh, and therefore, of
course, wholly useless. The only explanation of these
facts is that the ancestors of all the whales before they
had become whales were quadrupeds, which afterward
took to the water, and little by little the hind-legs, for
want of use, dwindled away to the useless remnants
which we now find.</p>

<p>3. Again, whales seem to be hairless, yet rudimentary
hairs are found in the skin. Their organs of smell are
rudimentary, but made on the pattern of those of mammals,
not of fishes&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., they are air-smelling, not
water-smelling organs. From all these, as well as many
other facts, it is evident that the whales descended in
early Tertiary times from some marsh-loving, powerful-tailed,
short-legged, scant-haired quadruped by modifications
gradually induced by increasing aquatic habits.</p>

<p>Examples of such rudimentary organs might be multiplied
without limit. As might be expected, some are
found even in man. Such, for example, are the muscles
for moving the ear, necessary in animals but useless in
man, and therefore rudimentary. Similarly useless in
man are the scalp-muscle, used by animals to erect the
crest or bristles on the head, and the skin-muscle of the
neck and chest, used by animals for shaking the skin of
those parts. Most persons have lost the power of using
these. For my part I can use them all&mdash;ear-muscles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
scalp-muscle, skin-muscle&mdash;but they serve no useful purpose.</p>

<p>Again, and finally, in man and many mammals we
find a slender, worm-like appendage about three inches
long, attached to the cæcum of the large intestine.
Anatomists and physiologists, under the influence of that
philosophy which maintains that every part of the fearfully
and wonderfully made human frame was <i>directly</i>
contrived to subserve some useful purpose, have puzzled
themselves to find the use of this. It probably has no
use; on the contrary, it is a continual source of danger.
If the human body had been made at once out of hand,
it would not have been there. How came it, then? It
is the rudimentary remnant of an organ&mdash;a greatly enlarged
cæcum&mdash;which has served, and in some mammals
still serves, a useful purpose. All these cases are survivals;
they are organs which, like many customs in
society, have outlived their usefulness, but still continue
by heredity.</p>

<p>But why multiply examples? All along the track of
evolution organs become useless by changes in the habits
of their possessors. They are not, however, shed or
dropped bodily at once. No; they are <i>retained by
heredity</i>, but <i>dwindle by disuse</i>, more and more, until
they pass away entirely. But even when they are entirely
gone in the adult, they are often found still lingering
in the embryo. They are among the most obvious
and convincing proofs of the origin of organic forms by
derivation.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROOFS FROM GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF
ORGANISMS.</span></h2>

<p>It is well known that the kinds of organisms found
in widely-separated countries differ more or less conspicuously.
The traveler in Australia or in Africa finds
all, the traveler in Europe nearly all, the animals and
plants wholly different from those he has been accustomed
to see at home. Even the visitor from the Atlantic
to the Pacific coast, if he observes at all, will
find nearly all organisms strange to him. The facts of
geographical diversity of organisms are so numerous
and complex that, at first sight, they seem utterly
lawless. Only recently this subject has been redeemed
from chaos and reduced to something like order and
law by the light thrown upon it by the theory of evolution.
We will give, in very brief outline, the most
important facts, and then show how they may be explained.</p>

<p><b>Geographical Faunas and Floras.</b>&mdash;The group of animals
and plants inhabiting any locality, whether peculiar
to that locality or not, is called, in popular language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
its fauna and flora. But, in a true scientific
sense, a fauna and flora is a <i>natural</i> group of animals
and plants in one place, <i>differing</i> more or less conspicuously
from other groups in other places, and <i>separated
from them by physico-geographical boundaries, or by
physical conditions of some kind.</i> The members of
such a group can only exist in certain harmonic relations
with external conditions, and with one another.
These relations with one another are often complex and
nicely adjusted, so that change in one term is propagated
through the whole series of terms, giving rise
often to the most unexpected results, until finally a
new equilibrium is established. Thus, the destruction
of certain insectivorous birds, in mere wanton sport,
may give rise to the multiplication of insect pests, and
this to the destruction of certain kinds of plants, and
this to the diminution of certain herbivores, and this
in its turn to the disappearance of certain carnivores.
It is well known that the introduction of rabbits into
New Zealand and Australia has produced the most unexpectedly
disastrous effect upon certain crops, on account
of the absence of the fierce and active carnivores
which keep in check their excessive multiplication in
Europe.</p>

<p>Now, among the physical conditions which limit
faunas and floras, and separate them from each other,
the most important and universal is temperature.</p>

<p><b>Temperature-Regions.</b>&mdash;If we travel from equator to
pole, we pass through mean temperatures varying from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
80° to 0°. This gives rise to a very regular zonal arrangement
of plant-forms: 1. We have first a region
in which palms and palm-like forms are abundant and
characteristic, and which therefore may be called the
region of palms. It corresponds with the tropic zone.
2. We next have a region in which hard-wood foliferous
trees are most abundant and characteristic; first
mostly evergreens and then deciduous trees, and therefore
may be called the region of hard-wood forests.
This corresponds with the temperate-zone. 3. Then we
find a region characterized predominantly by pines and
pine-like trees and birches, and may be called the
region of pines. This is the sub-Arctic region. 4.
Then a region without trees, but only shrubs and
summer plants. This is the Arctic region. 5. And,
finally, an almost wholly plantless region of perpetual
ice&mdash;the polar region.</p>

<p>These regions are determined wholly by temperature,
and therefore, in going up a mountain-slope to snowy
summits, we pass through similar regions in smaller
space. For example, in going from sea-level to the
summits of the Sierra, 14,000 to 15,000 feet high, we
commence in a region of predominantly hard-wood
trees; but at 3,000 feet the forests become almost
wholly coniferous, at 11,000 to 12,000 feet the vegetation
becomes shrubby, and at 13,000 feet we reach
perpetual snow.</p>

<p>We have taken plants first, because these, being
fixed to the soil and incapable of voluntary seasonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
migrations, are more strictly and simply limited by
temperature&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the arrangement of different kinds
in zones is more simple and conspicuous. But the
same rule holds also for animals. In passing from
equator to pole, animal kinds also change frequently,
so that there are many temperature-faunas in which
the animals are all very different. In both animals
and plants, species, genera, families, etc., are limited
by temperature. These are familiar facts; we recall
them to the reader in order that we may base thereon
a clearer definition of these limits.</p>

<p><b>More Perfect Definition of Regions.</b>&mdash;1. The area
over which any form spreads is called its <i>range</i>. Now,
the range of a species is more restricted than that of
a genus, because, when a species is limited by temperature,
another species of the same genus may carry on
the genus. For the same reason the range of a family
is usually greater than that of a genus, and so on for
higher classification-groups. For example, pines range
on the slopes of the Sierra from about 2,000 feet to
11,000 feet, but not the same species. In ascending,
we meet first the nut-pine (<i>Pinus Sabiniana</i>), then the
yellow-pine (<i>P. ponderosa</i>), then the sugar-pine (<i>P.
Lambertiana</i>), then the tamarack-pine (<i>P. contorta</i>),
and last, the <i>Pinus flexilis</i>, etc.</p>

<div id="Fig_64" class="figright" style="width: 178px;"><img src="images/fig-64.jpg" width="178" height="132" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></div></div>

<p>2. Where two contiguous temperature-regions come
in contact, there is no sharp line between; on the contrary,
they <i>shade gradually</i>, almost imperceptibly, into
one another, the ranges of species overlapping and interpenetrating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
and the two species coexisting on the
borders of their ranges. This is represented by the
diagram (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>), in which the horizontal lines represent
the north and south ranges
of species of two groups, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and
<span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, separated by the dotted line.</p>

<p>3. Species also pass out
gradually on the borders of
these ranges and others come
in gradually, so <i>far as number
and vigor of individuals are concerned</i>. If <i>a a′</i> and <i>b b′</i>
(<a href="#Fig_65">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>) represent the north and south range of two
species, and <i>b a′</i> their overlap or area of coexistence,
then the height of the curves <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">B</span> will represent the
number and vigor of the individuals in different parts
of the range.</p>

<div id="Fig_65" class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;"><img src="images/fig-65.jpg" width="356" height="62" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span></div></div>

<p>4. While, therefore, there is a shading of contiguous
groups into each other by overlap of species-ranges;
while there is also a gradual passing out of species so far
as number and vigor of individuals is concerned, yet, in
<i>specific characters</i> we observe usually no such gradation.
Species seem to come in on one border with all their specific
characters perfect, remain substantially unchanged
throughout their range, and pass out on the other border,
still the same species. In other words, one species takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the place of another, usually by <i>substitution</i>, not by
<i>transmutation</i>. It is <i>as if</i> species had originated, no
matter how, each in its own region, and had spread in
all directions as far as physical conditions and struggle
with other species would allow. This important subject
will be more fully discussed later.</p>

<p>5. We have thus far spoken of species as limited by
temperature alone, but they are limited also by <i>barriers</i>.
If, then, there be an east and west barrier, such as a high
mountain-range, or a wide sea or desert, there will be no
shading or gradation of any kind, because the barrier
prevents overlapping, interpenetration, and struggle on
the margins. For example: The species north and south
of the Himalayas, or north and south of Sahara, are
widely different. It is, again, <i>as if</i> they originated each
where we find them and spread as far as they could, but
the physical barrier prevented mingling and shading.</p>

<p>6. There are temperature-regions south as well as
north of the equator. Now, although the climatic conditions
are quite similar, the species of corresponding
temperature-regions north and south are wholly different.
It is, again, as if they originated where we find
them, and were kept separate by the barrier of tropical
heat between. If carried over, they often do perfectly
well.</p>

<h3><i>Continental Faunas and Floras.</i></h3>

<p>If the land-surfaces were continuous all around the
globe, there is little doubt that each temperature region
with its characteristic species would also be substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
continuous. There would, it is true, be some local variations
dependent upon soil and humidity, etc., but substantially
the same species would exist all around. The
distribution would be almost wholly zonal. But the intervening
oceans are complete barriers to continental
species. Hence we ought to expect, and do find, that the
faunas and floras of different continents are almost totally
different.
Each apparently
originated on its
own continent,
and did not
spread to other
continents, only
because they
could not get
there. It is necessary
to explain
this in more detail.</p>

<div id="Fig_66" class="figright" style="width: 293px;"><img src="images/fig-66.jpg" width="293" height="293" alt="" /><div class="captionl hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>&mdash;Polar projection of the earth. 1, tropical;
2, temperate; 3, sub-arctic; 4, arctic; 5, polar regions.</div></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> represents
a polar view
of the earth, showing the eastern and western continents,
and the five temperature zones already described.
Now, if we examine the species in each region, commencing
at the pole, we find that those of Nos. 5
and 4 are almost identical all around. The reason is
obvious. The continents come close together there,
with ice-connection if not land-connection all around.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
There is but one circumpolar region. But, as soon as
we come down to No. 3 and No. 2, the species on the
two continents are nearly all different, because there
is an impassable barrier between, either in the form of
ocean or of Arctic cold. For example, the animals and
plants inhabiting the United States are almost wholly
different from those in Europe, not only in species,
but even largely in genera and to some extent in families.
There are some exceptions to this rule, but these are of
the kind which prove the rule, or rather the principle on
which the rule is founded. These exceptions are mainly
of three kinds: 1. <i>Introduced species.</i>&mdash;All our weeds,
many garden-plants, and many animal pests are of this
kind. They were not found here when America was
discovered, only because they could not get here; for,
when brought here, they do so well that they often overrun
the country and dispossess the native species, as we
ourselves have done the Indians. 2. <i>Hardy or else wide-migrating
species.</i>&mdash;Hardy species have wide range; they
may belong to No. 4 as well as No. 3. If so, they range
down to No. 3 on both continents. Migrating birds, such
as ducks and geese, etc., breed in summer in No. 4, and
migrate southward in winter on both continents from the
common circumpolar ground. 3. <i>Alpine species.</i>&mdash;It is
a curious fact that species on tops of snowy mountains
in temperate regions of the two continents are wonderfully
similar, though so completely isolated. We are not yet
prepared to discuss this point. We shall do so later.
Suffice it to say now that it can be completely explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
In region No. 1 the continental diversity is still
greater. Not only species and genera, but whole families
and even orders, are peculiar to each continent. The
great pachyderms&mdash;elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus&mdash;are
peculiar to the Eastern; the edentates&mdash;sloths and
armadillos&mdash;to the Western. The humming-birds, those
gems of the forests, of which there are over four hundred
species, and the whole cactus family, are peculiar
to America, while the tailless monkeys are equally characteristic
of the Eastern Continent.</p>

<p>The continents do not come together again toward
the south, and, therefore, as might be expected, the
great difference between the two persists to the southern
points. The faunas of the southern points of South
America, Africa, and Australia are very different.</p>

<p><b>Subdivisions of Continental Faunas and Floras.</b>&mdash;Besides
the subdivisions of continental faunas, north and
south, determined by temperature as already explained,
if there be in any continent an impassable barrier running
north and south, there will be a corresponding difference
in the species on the two sides, east and west.
We give but one example: The North American Cordilleras
or Rocky Mountains, with their high ranges and
desert plains, constitute a very great barrier between
the eastern and western portions of the United States.
Hence, we find an extraordinary difference between the
species inhabiting California and those found in the eastern
portion of the country. Speaking generally, all the
species and many of the genera are peculiar. The exceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
too, are significant. Leaving out introduced
species, of which there are many, they are mostly strong-winged
or widely-migrating birds, such as the turtle-dove,
the turkey-buzzard, the bald eagle, and, of
course, many water-birds.</p>

<p><b>Special Cases.</b>&mdash;If any body of land is widely separated
from all other lands by deep seas, we invariably
find a corresponding peculiarity of its species. Thus,
the species inhabiting Australia and Madagascar are perhaps
the most peculiar in the world. We do not dwell
further on these, because we will discuss them hereafter.
There is a little group of very small islands&mdash;the Galapagos&mdash;about
six hundred miles off the western coast of
South America, and surrounded on all sides by deep sea.
These islands are stocked with a collection of curious
animals not found elsewhere on the surface of the earth;
but among them are no mammals at all. We might
multiply examples without limit. Even the rivers emptying
in the same sea sometimes have each its peculiar species
of mussels. In the Altamaha River there are several
species of unios&mdash;such, for instance, as the wonderful
spinous unio&mdash;not found elsewhere. How came they
there? Howsoever they may have come there, they are
now kept isolated there by barriers of land and of salt
water.</p>

<p>Many other curious details will come up in our discussion
of the origin of diversity.</p>

<p><b>Marine Species.</b>&mdash;Precisely the same principles apply
here; but diversity in the case of marine species is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
perhaps less marked, and certainly less general, because
of the universal oceanic connection. Open-sea species
are therefore almost universal. But many marine species
are confined to shallow water, and therefore to
shore-lines. The species on the two shores of the same
ocean, or the two coasts of the same continent, are different,
being isolated east and west by barriers of deep
sea or of land, and north and south by temperature.
Also about isolated lands, like Australia and Madagascar,
the species are peculiar.</p>

<p>Thus, then, species, genera, etc., are limited in every
direction; north and south by temperature, and in all directions
by barriers, in the form of oceans, deserts, and
mountain-chains. Add to these, peculiar climates and
soils, and we see that, from this point of view, the
whole surface of the earth may be divided and sub-divided
into regions, sub-regions, provinces, etc. It
would carry us too far to explain the primary and
secondary divisions adopted by Mr. Wallace, and the
somewhat different ones suggested by Mr. Allen. Our
main object is to discuss the <i>cause</i> of this diversity,
and especially to show the light shed upon it by the
theory of evolution. We have only given a sketch of
the facts sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<h3><i>Theory of the Origin of Geographical Diversity.</i></h3>

<p>It will be observed that all along we have assumed
a sort of provisional theory. We have said in every
case, it is <i>as if</i> organic forms originated where we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
them, and have gone thence wherever they could&mdash;as
far in every direction as physical conditions and struggle
with competing species would allow. This view
has been formulated as the “theory of specific centers
of origin.” There would be less objection to this as a
first provisional theory did it not assume a supernatural
<i>mode</i> of origin. But, in the minds of those who
hold it, it has usually assumed expressly or tacitly the
form of “<i>specific centers of creation</i>,” thus implying
the immutability of specific types and the supernaturalism
of specific origin (<a href="#Page_68">page&nbsp;68</a>). In this latter or
usual form it completely fails to account for the facts
given above. For, if this were the mode of origin,
each species ought in every case to be perfectly adapted
to its own environment, and to no other. But, on the
contrary, introduced species often flourish better than
in their own country, and better than the natives of
their new homes. In the less objectionable form of
“specific centers of origin,” without defining the mode
of origin, it accounts well for many of the more obvious
facts of geographical diversity, as it <i>now</i> exists, but
not all. According to this view, the amount of diversity
ought to be in strict proportion to the completeness
of isolation, or impassableness of the separating
barriers; but this is not <i>exactly</i> true. There is another
element, not yet mentioned, which is just as important
as impassableness, but which until recently has been
left entirely out of account. This is the element of
<i>time</i>&mdash;the amount of time since the barrier was set up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
or during which it has continued to exist. These two
elements, it is true, are closely connected with each
other; for, since all changes in physical geography have
taken place very slowly&mdash;since barriers in the form of
mountain-ranges and seas have increased by slow process
of growth&mdash;it is evident that impassableness is, to
some extent, a measure of time. But they are by no
means in strict proportion. The one or the other may
predominate.</p>

<p>Now, this time-element connects geographical distribution
with changes of physical geography and climate
in <i>geological</i> times, and especially with the <i>latest</i> of
these changes, viz., those occurring during the <i>Glacial
epoch</i>. During that remarkable epoch extraordinary
changes of climate, from extreme Arctic rigor to great
mildness, enforced wide migrations of species southward
and northward; while concomitant changes of physical
geography, by elevation of the earth’s crust over wide
areas, opened highways between previously-isolated continents,
permitting migrations in various directions, and
by subsequent depression again isolating the migrated
species in their new homes. It is evident, then, that
the recognition of the element of almost unlimited
time at once introduces into the question of geographical
distribution the <i>idea of evolution</i>. If the study of
geographical distribution, as <i>it now exists</i>, and as a
part of science of physical geography, gave rise naturally
to the theory of “specific centers of origin,” the
study of the same, in connection with geological time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
and as a part of geological science, now demands its
explanation by the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, then, that geographical
diversity of organisms is not a question of the present
epoch only. There has been geographical diversity in
every previous geological epoch; it is, therefore, a question
of geology as well as of biology. It is probable,
however, that diversity has increased with the course
of geological times, and is greater now than ever before.
In other words, in the evolution of the organic
kingdom, the law of differentiation has prevailed here,
as in other departments of biology. A clear statement
of the causes of the <i>present</i> distribution of organisms
must embrace also the causes of geographical diversity
<i>generally</i>. We give, therefore, at once a brief statement
of what seems to us the most probable view, and
shall then proceed to show how it explains the present
distribution.</p>

<p><b>Most Probable View of the General Process.</b>&mdash;Bearing
in mind, then, this time-element, the phenomena
of geographical diversity are best explained by the following
suppositions: 1. A gradual progressive movement
(evolution) of the organic kingdom, marching,
as it were, abreast, at equal rate along the whole line&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
in all parts of the earth, and throughout all geological
times, under the action of all the forces or factors,
and following all the laws, of evolution already explained
(pages 19 and 73). If this were all, there would
be no <i>geographical</i> diversity, although <i>organic diversity</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
might be as great as it is now. There would be differentiation
of forms and structure everywhere, but no
differentiation of groups in different localities. 2.
Under the influence of different conditions in different
places, more or less isolated from one another by climatic
or physical barriers, the onward movement (evolution)
of organic forms takes different directions and
different rates, and gives rise to local groups, which
become more and more differentiated, without limit as
time goes on. This element, acting by itself throughout
all geological times, would ere this have produced
an extreme geographical diversity, such as does not anywhere
exist. 3. From time to time, at long intervals,
extensive changes of physical geography and climate,
produced by crust elevations, partly enforce by change
of temperature, and partly permit by opening of gateways,
extensive migrations and dispersals of species, by
which mingling and struggle for life and final readjustment
takes place, and extreme diversity is prevented.
Such mingling of different faunas and floras on the same
ground, and the severe struggle for life that thus ensues,
and the survival of the fittest in many directions, are, as
already shown, among the most powerful factors of evolution.
They tend to <i>increase organic</i> diversity, but to
<i>diminish geographical</i> diversity. 4. At the close of such
great periods of change as indicated in the last, by contrary
movement of the earth-crust&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., subsidence&mdash;new
barriers are set up and new isolations are produced,
and the process of divergence again commences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
increases steadily so long as the barriers continue to
exist.</p>

<p>Now, the last of these periods of great changes and
extensive migrations, and subsequent isolations, was the
Glacial epoch. It was this epoch, therefore, which
mainly determined the present geographical distribution
of species. Thus, the present distribution is a key
to the directions of the last great migrations, and therefore
to the nature of the changes in physical geography
and climate which then occurred; and, conversely,
the character of these changes, determined in other
ways, <i>furnishes the only key to the present distribution
of species</i>.</p>

<p>Before applying the foregoing principles in the explanation
of special cases, it may be well to give a very
brief outline of the condition of things during the Glacial
epoch.</p>

<p>In America, during this epoch, by increasing cold
the southern margin of the great northern ice-sheet
crept slowly southward, until it reached the latitude of
about 38° to 40°. Arctic species were thus driven
southward slowly, from generation to generation, until
they occupied the whole of the United States, as far
as the shores of the Gulf, while temperate species
were forced still farther south, into Central and South
America. This period of extreme rigor and southward
migration was followed by a period of great mildness,
during which the ice and its accompanying Arctic conditions
retreated northward, followed by Arctic species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
More than one advance and retreat, apparently, occurred
during this time. Again, during the same time,
brought about by northern elevation, there was broader
connection than now exists between North and South
America, and free migrations between, in both directions,
enforced by extreme changes in temperature.
Also, during this or previous time, there were broad
connections between North America and Asia, in the
region of Behring Strait, and between America and
Europe, in high-latitude regions, and extensive migrations
of faunas and floras between were thus permitted.
The necessary result of all these migrations of species,
partly enforced by changes of climate, partly permitted
by opening of gateways since closed, was exceptionally
rapid changes in organic forms. This was the result of
two causes: First, the severer pressure of a changing
physical environment; and, second, a severer struggle
for life between the natives and the invaders.</p>

<p>In Europe, during the same time and from similar
causes, there were at least three or four different faunas
struggling together for mastery on the same soil. First,
there were the Pliocene indigenes, who had, if any,
pre-emption right to the soil; second, invaders from
Arctic regions, driven southward by increasing cold;
third, invaders from Asia, permitted by the removal
of the old sea-barrier which once extended from the
Black Sea to the Arctic, and of which the Caspian and
Aral are existing remnants, and thus opening a gateway
for migration which has remained open ever since;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
fourth, invaders from Europe and Asia into Africa,
and sometimes back again into Europe, by opening of
gateways through the Mediterranean, which have been
since closed. One of these highways was through Gibraltar,
and one from Italy to Africa through Sicily.
As in America, so here, in even greater degree, the
severe pressure of changing environment and the severe
struggle for life produced rapid changes of organic
forms. Many species were destroyed; others saved
themselves by modifications adapted more perfectly to
the changed conditions. There is little doubt that
man came into Europe with the Asiatic invasion, and
was one of the principal agents of change, especially
in the way of destruction of many old forms.</p>

<p>Such is a very brief outline of the last great geological
change and its general results. Being the last,
this one has left the strongest and most universal impress
on the <i>present</i> geographical distribution. But
similar changes by crust oscillations, if not also by
extreme changes of climate, have repeatedly occurred
in geological times, and some of the most remarkable
geographical faunas and floras are the result of these
earlier geological changes. We will now give a few
examples illustrating these principles:</p>

<p>1. <i>Australia</i> is undoubtedly more peculiar in its
fauna and flora than any other known country. Not
only are all its species peculiar, not found elsewhere
on the face of the earth, but its genera, its families,
and even many of its orders of animals and plants, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
also peculiar. These facts are so familiar that it is
unnecessary to dwell on them. I need only mention,
among plants, the whole of the simple-leaved acacias,
already mentioned on <a href="#Page_86">page&nbsp;86</a>, of which there are so
many species, and the whole family of the eucalyptids,
of which there are several hundred species. Among
animals I need mention only the order of monotremes,
or egg-laying mammals, and nearly the whole order of
marsupials, or pouched animals, of which there are
over two hundred species. On the other hand, the
true typical mammals are entirely absent, with the exception
of a few bats and a few rats, which have evidently
been accidentally introduced from abroad.</p>

<p>Another very noteworthy fact, which must be taken
in connection with the last, is that Australian forms
are far less advanced in the race of evolution than
those of any other country&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., that many old forms
which have long ago become extinct elsewhere are still
retained there. A few examples will suffice. The marsupials
just mentioned are an old form once universally
distributed, but now nearly extinct everywhere, except
in Australia; the cestracion, or Port Jackson shark,
and the ceratodus, are Palæozoic and Mesozoic forms
retained only in Australia.</p>

<p>What is the explanation of these remarkable facts?
We find the sufficient answer in the fact that Australia
has been long isolated from all other countries. While
geographical changes in geological times have mingled
more or less the organic forms of other countries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the sharp struggle for life has produced more rapid advance
and the production of many new and higher forms
better armed for the battle of life, Australia has remained
isolated from competition, and therefore comparatively
unprogressive.</p>

<p>Can we tell when Australia was finally isolated? Approximately
we can. The class of mammals is divided
into two groups, which differ widely from each other;
so widely, that they are called sub-classes. These are
placental mammals, or true typical mammals, and non-placental
or reptilian mammals. The non-placentals include
only the marsupials and the monotremes (ornithorhyncus
and echidna). The monotremes actually lay
eggs and incubate them. In the marsupials the embryo
has no placental connection with the mother, and is
born in a very imperfect condition, utterly unfit for independent
life, and placed in the pouch (marsupium),
and <i>permanently</i> attached there to the teat until it is
capable of independent life; after which only it voluntarily
nurses like other new-borns. In other words, the
gestation commenced in the womb is completed in the
pouch. The uterine gestation in the opossum is only
seventeen days, while the marsupial gestation is about
two and a half months. In a kangaroo seven feet high
in sitting position the embryo at birth is only one inch
long&mdash;a pink, hairless, almost amorphous mass. The
monotremes are pure oviparous animals, like birds and
reptiles. The marsupials might well be called <i>semi-oviparous</i>.
In pure egg-layers the whole embryonic development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
is outside of the body; in pure young-bearers
the whole is within the body; in marsupials it is partly
within and partly without. Now&mdash;1. The monotremes
are found nowhere but in Australia and the neighboring
New Guinea. 2. The marsupials are also all confined
to the Australian region, except a few oppossums
in America. 3. There are some two hundred and thirty
species of non-placentals in the Australian region.
4. As already said, there are no true mammals at all in
Australia, except a few bats and rats which have come
accidentally from abroad. 5. But non-placentals existed
abundantly in <i>Mesozoic times everywhere</i>, both in Europ-Asia
and in America, while true mammals did not
appear at all on the surface of the earth until the <i>Tertiary</i>,
when they almost immediately became very abundant
everywhere, except in Australia. <i>Evidently, therefore,
Australia was isolated before the Tertiary.</i> The
enormous difference between its fauna and flora and
those of other countries is due to at least three things:
1. So long an isolation necessarily produced great divergence
of forms. This alone, however, would not affect
the <i>grade of organization</i>. 2. Saved from wide migrations,
and especially invasions from Eurasia, the great
field of competitive struggle, it was left far behind in
the race of evolution. Hence many of its forms are archaic;
its mammalian fauna, for instance, is still in the
Mesozoic stage. 3. Its distance from other large continents
is so great that accidental colonization has been
very slight, only extending to a few bats and a few rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
I stop a moment to insist on the effect of competitive
struggle in developing organic forms strong for the battle
of life. Of all the continents, Eurasia has been the scene
of most frequent geological changes, and therefore the
arena of fiercest competitive struggle through wide and
frequent migrations. Eurasian species, therefore, are
the strongest of all. They have conquered wherever
they have gone. Species in isolated regions are usually
the weakest. The great moas and the dodo could not
have continued to exist unless protected in a sort of
bomb-proof. Kangaroos would now be quickly exterminated
by the introduction of fierce Eurasian carnivores.</p>

<p>2. <i>Africa.</i>&mdash;The fauna of that part of Africa north
of Sahara is essentially Mediterranean&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., a sub-group
of the Eurasian. Sahara, rather than the Mediterranean
Sea, is the true intercontinental barrier. The true African
region, therefore, is south of Sahara. Now, according
to Mr. Wallace, whom I mainly follow here, the true
African mammalian fauna consists of two very different
groups of animals. The one is a group of very small,
curious animals, mostly low forms of insectivores and
lemurs, very peculiar to this region, though more resembling
those of Madagascar than of any other region; the
other is a group of large and powerful animals which
dominate the region. These latter are similar to, though
not identical with, those which inhabited Eurasia in Pliocene
times. The great carnivores, pachyderms, and ruminants
of the region are examples of this group. Now,
the explanation of these facts is as follows: The indigenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
of Africa are the animals of the first group. Africa,
in Tertiary times, was isolated from the great field of
combat, Eurasia, and therefore its animals were small, of
low grade, and peculiar. During later Tertiary (Pliocene)
times, then, Africa was inhabited by animals of the
first group, while Eurasia was dominated by animals of
the second group. These two groups were then separated
by the Desert of Sahara, or else by a sea in that region.
Some time during the Glacial epoch geographical
changes removed this barrier, and climatic changes drove
the Eurasian animals southward into Africa, where, finding
congenial climate, they took possession of the continent,
dominating the feebler natives. Subsequently they
were isolated there by the formation of the desert, and
the process of divergence commenced, and has gone on
to the formation of many new forms. Meanwhile the
change, partly by extinction and partly by modification,
has gone on still more rapidly in Eurasia, but in a different
direction. Hence, Africa is regarded as one of the
primary faunal regions.</p>

<p>3. <i>Madagascar.</i>&mdash;This, next to the Australian, is
probably the most peculiar faunal region known. There
is probably not a single mammalian species found there
which is known to occur anywhere else. It is remarkable
also as the principal home of that strange, generalized,
ancient form of monkeys&mdash;the lemurs. And yet its animals,
though very different, have a distant resemblance to
those of Africa; not, however, to the present dominant
type, but to those we have called the indigenes. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
one of the northern invaders is found there. The obvious
conclusion from these facts is, that Madagascar
was formerly united with Africa, and both were occupied
by the same mammalian fauna (which may be called African
indigenes, although they were considerably different
from their descendants of the present day), but became
separated before the northern invasion. The effect
of this invasion was to hasten the steps of change in the indigenous
fauna of Africa, partly by extermination, partly
by modification, while the isolated portion in Madagascar
went on at the usual slow rate of change in isolated regions.
The time since the separation (which was certainly
during the Tertiary period) has been sufficiently
long to produce very great divergence in both, but <i>especially
in the African indigenes</i>. In the fauna of Madagascar,
therefore, we have a nearer approach to the original
fauna of both. On account of this long isolation, we
have here many ancient types which are extinct elsewhere.
The lemurs are such an ancient type. These are
a wonderfully-generalized type of monkeys&mdash;a connecting
link between monkeys and other mammals, especially
insectivores. As might be supposed, from the law of differentiation,
already explained (<a href="#Page_11">page&nbsp;11</a>), they are the
earliest form, the progenitors, of monkeys. In fact, in
early Tertiary times, they were found not only in Africa
and Madagascar, but all over the earth, as the only representatives
of the monkey family. The true monkeys
were not introduced until the mid-Tertiary. In Eurasia
and in America (which at that time was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
connected with Eurasia) wide migrations and frequent
conflicts of faunas produced comparatively rapid evolution
of new and higher forms, while in isolated Africa
old types continued until the invasion. Madagascar was
spared this invasion, and therefore old types are still preserved
there. At present, at least three quarters of all
lemurs are confined to Madagascar, although a few species
are still found in Africa and in the great East Indian
islands.</p>

<p>4. <b>Island-Life.</b>&mdash;Mr. Wallace has divided islands into
two kinds, continental and oceanic islands. The division
is undoubtedly a good one, although we may not always
be able to refer an example with certainty to the one or
the other class. <i>Continental</i> islands are those on the borders
of continents, and separated from the latter only by
<i>shallow water</i>. <i>Oceanic</i> islands are those, usually very
small, found in the midst of the ocean, with abyssal
depth all about. Continental islands may be regarded as
appendages to the neighboring continent&mdash;as outliers of
continents separated by submergence, and have, in fact,
been thus formed. Oceanic islands have been formed
geologically recently by volcanic action building up from
the sea-bottom. Continental islands have a continental
structure&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., they are composed of stratified as well
as of igneous rocks. Their structure is a record of
geological history, like that of the neighboring continent.
Oceanic islands are composed wholly of volcanic rocks;
or, if there be any stratified rocks, these are only of the
most recent date. As examples of continental islands we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
have New Zealand as an appendage of Australia, the
great East Indian (Borneo, Java, Sumatra, etc.) and the
Japanese Islands, etc., as appendages of Asia; the British
Islands, appendages of Europe; the West Indian Islands,
appendages of America; Madagascar, an appendage of
Africa, etc., etc. As examples of oceanic islands we
have the Azores and Bermudas in the Atlantic, and the
Polynesian islands in mid-Pacific.</p>

<p><i>a. Continental Islands.</i>&mdash;Now, the fauna of continental
islands, as might be expected from the mode of
origin of these islands, is similar to, though not identical
with, that of the neighboring continent; the amount of
difference being in proportion to the <i>length of time since</i>
they were separated and the <i>width of the separation</i>.
<i>Madagascar</i>, for example, has been long separated from
its parent continent, and by a wide and deep channel.
Its fauna, therefore, differs greatly from that of Africa,
although resembling it more than that of any other
country. The separation of <i>New Zealand</i> from Australia
has been not quite so long, and the divergence,
therefore, is not so great. These two will be sufficient
illustrative examples of long separation, and therefore
of great differentiation of forms.</p>

<div id="Fig_67" class="figright" style="width: 452px;"><img src="images/fig-67.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Map of outline of coast of Western Europe, if elevated 600
feet (after Lyell).</div></div>

<p>On the other hand, the British Isles are an excellent
example of comparatively recent separation. These isles
have probably been several times united and separated
from Europe, but we are here concerned only with the
more recent. They are now separated from the continent
and from one another only by shallow seas. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
elevation of less than six hundred feet&mdash;geologically a
very small change&mdash;would bare the bottoms of the Irish
and English Channels and the North Sea, and connect
these islands with one another and with the continent
(<a href="#Fig_67">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>). Now, it is well known that there were during
the Glacial epoch, and subsequently, several oscillations
of level sufficient to connect and separate these
islands. In the mid-Glacial epoch the British Islands,
by submergence, were nearly obliterated, being reduced
to an archipelago of small islets representing the high
mountains of Wales and Scotland. The Pliocene fauna
and flora were, therefore, largely exterminated. During
the close of that epoch they were elevated above the
present condition and broadly connected with the continent
(<a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>), and the newly-exposed land was taken
possession of by European species, man among the number.
Still later&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., at the beginning of the present
epoch&mdash;the islands by subsidence were again separated,
but not widely, from the continent. This is the condition
now. What, then, was the result? 1. The fauna
and flora of the British Isles are substantially the same,
but <i>less rich</i> in species than that of Continental Europe,
some of the European species being wanting. This shows
that the last connection was not a long one; the colonization
had not been completed before re-isolation. 2.
This poverty of species is more conspicuous in Ireland,
because colonization is progressive in space as well as in
time. Some species had not reached so far when Ireland
was re-isolated from England. The conspicuous absence
of snakes, for example, is thus accounted for. There is,
we all know, another theory to account for this, but we
prefer the natural one. 3. The difference between British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and European fauna and flora is very small, it is
true, but there is some difference, varietal if not specific.
The reason is, that the time since separation is too small
to produce much divergence, and the width of the existing
barriers not great enough to prevent colonization by
accidental causes.</p>

<p>The continental islands of the southern coast of
Asia are good examples of an intermediate condition as
to the length of time since separation, and of the
consequent degree of differentiation of the faunas and
floras.</p>

<p><i>Coast-Islands of California.</i>&mdash;We give one more example,
and dwell upon it a little, because it occurs on our
own coast.</p>

<p>The recent studies of Mr. E.&nbsp;L. Greene on the flora
of the islands off the coast of California have brought to
light some facts which are an admirable illustration of
the principles laid down above.</p>

<p>On looking at a good map of California, any one will
observe eight or ten islands, some of them of considerable
size, strung along the coast from Point Conception
southward, and separated from the mainland by a sound
twenty to thirty miles wide. They are in structure true
continental islands&mdash;outliers of the mainland separated
by a subsidence of a few hundred feet. Moreover, the
date of their separation is known. They were certainly
connected with the mainland during the later Pliocene
and early Quaternary, for bones of the mammoth, characteristic
of that time, have been found on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
<span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> They were therefore separated during the Glacial
epoch.</p>

<p>The main peculiarities of the flora of these islands are
the following:</p>

<p>1. Out of nearly three hundred species of plants gathered
by Mr. Greene, about fifty are wholly peculiar to
these islands. 2. Of the remaining two hundred and fifty
species, nearly all are distinctively Californian. In other
words, the distinctively Californian forms are very abundant,
while the common American forms are rare&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
the island flora is distinctively Californian, with many
peculiar species added.</p>

<p>I explain these facts as follows: The whole coast-region
of California is geologically very recent, having
emerged from the sea as late as the beginning of the Pliocene
epoch. As soon as emerged it was of course colonized
from adjacent parts. Since that time its peculiar
flora has been formed by gradual modification. The environment
has been sufficiently peculiar, the isolation
sufficiently complete, and the time sufficiently long, to
make a very distinct group of organisms. It is one of
Mr. Wallace’s primary divisions of the Ne-arctic region.</p>

<p>During late Pliocene and early Quaternary times, as
already said, the islands were still a part of the mainland,
and the whole was occupied by the same species, viz.,
the distinctively Californian species now found in both,
together, as I suppose, with the peculiar island species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
During the oscillations of the glacial times the islands
were separated by subsidence of the continental margin.
Simultaneously with this subsidence, or subsequently
thereto, came the invasion of northern species, driven
southward by glacial cold. Then came the mingling of
invaders with natives, the struggle for mastery, the extermination
of many forms&mdash;viz., the peculiar island species&mdash;and
the slight modification of others, and the final
result is the California flora of to-day. But the island
flora was spared this invasion by isolation. Therefore
the invading species are mostly wanting, the distinctive
island species were saved, and the result is the island flora
of to-day. The island flora, therefore, somewhat nearly
represents the Pliocene indigenes of both.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this case is somewhat like
that of Madagascar, but with a characteristic difference.
In the case of Madagascar, the separation has been long.
The extreme peculiarity of its fauna is the result partly
of progressive divergence and partly of many forms saved
by isolation. In the case of the coast-islands of California,
the time has not been long enough for any great
divergence by modification. The peculiarity of its species
is due almost wholly to species saved by <span class="locked">isolation.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span></p>

<p><i>b. Oceanic Islands.</i>&mdash;We have seen that faunas and
floras of continental islands are somewhat similar to those
of the neighboring continent, though with varying degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
of difference&mdash;the amount of difference, or divergence by
evolution, being in proportion to the amount of time and
the impassableness of the separating barriers. But oceanic
islands have never been connected with any continent.
They are new land formed in the midst of the ocean by
volcanic action. When they first appeared they were, of
course, without inhabitants of any kind, animal or vegetal.
How were they peopled? We answer by <i>waifs</i>
from here and there&mdash;by <i>castaways from other lands</i>.
The dominance of particular kinds will depend on the
direction of winds and currents, bringing from some
lands more than others, and upon the kinds of animals
or seeds of plants most liable to be successfully carried
across wide seas. Their faunas and floras, therefore, are
characterized by a mixture of species resembling, though
not usually identical with, those of various lands, with a
predominance of those of some one land, and by the
singular and complete absence of mammals and amphibians,
these being unlikely to be transported by floating
timber, as are small reptiles and insects, etc. Among
mammals, however, there is a significant exception in
favor of bats, the reason being both their power of flight
and their habit of concealment in hollow trees, etc. To
this explanation, however, we must add that divergence
by isolation will meanwhile go on in proportion to time.
The Azores, for example, have been peopled from Europe,
Africa, and America, but mostly from Europe, on
account of the prevailing winds and currents being favorable
to colonization from that direction. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
many curious peculiarities in the species, however, because
colonization is very slow, and divergent variation
has been going on <i>pari passu</i>. The Bermudas, on the
other hand, have been colonized mainly from America,
because of the current of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>These few examples are sufficient for our purpose,
which is only to illustrate the causes of geographical distribution.
If any one desires to pursue this interesting
subject, we would refer him to that most fascinating
book, Mr. Wallace’s “Island-Life.”</p>

<p>5. <b>Alpine Species.</b>&mdash;These afford an admirable illustration
of the fact that in isolated faunas and floras the
amount of difference is proportioned not only to the
completeness of isolation, but also and mainly to the
<i>time of isolation</i>.</p>

<p>It is well known that Alpine species&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., those species
inhabiting the region bordering the perpetual snow
of lofty mountains&mdash;are very similar to one another, even
in the most distant localities, where their isolation from
one another is as complete as possible; as, for example, in
the high Alps of Europe, the high mountains of Colorado
and California. Why is this? We find the key to
this mystery in the additional fact that <i>they are similar
also to Arctic species</i>. A somewhat full explanation is
here necessary.</p>

<p>During Miocene times, magnolias and taxodiums (bald
cypress), like those in forests and swamps of Carolina
and Louisiana, and sequoias and libocedrus like those
now in California, and many other temperate-region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
forms of plants, grew abundantly in Greenland, and northward
certainly to 75° north latitude. At that time there
could not have been any perpetual polar ice, and therefore
no Arctic species, unless on <i>high mountains in polar
regions</i>. In Pliocene times perpetual polar ice, and therefore
Arctic species, probably commenced to appear. As
the cold of the Glacial epoch came on and increased in
severity, the polar ice extended southward as a general
ice-sheet, until it reached in America 40° and in Europe
about 50° north latitude. In the United States its margin
can be traced as a distinct moraine through Long
Island, middle New Jersey, middle Pennsylvania; thence,
less distinctly, following the Ohio River, crossing the Mississippi;
thence following the Missouri, on its south side,
into Montana. By the increasing cold, Arctic species
were driven slowly southward, generation after generation,
until they occupied the whole of the United States
to the Gulf, and the whole of Europe to the Mediterranean.
As these species on the two continents came from
a <i>common home</i> in polar regions, they were similar to
one another, except in so far as some slight divergent
modification may have been produced during their southward
travel. When the glacial rigor declined, and the
ice-sheet gradually retreated to its present position, Arctic
species, following the snow-edge, went also northward,
on both continents, to their present home in polar
regions. But there was an alternative way of migration
left open which was embraced by certain plants and insects.
While on both continents most individuals went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
northward, some of them went upward, following the snow-edge
into high mountains, and were left <i>stranded there</i>.
Thus it has come to pass that the plants and insects of high
mountains in temperate regions of different continents,
though so widely separated and impassably isolated, are
extremely similar to one another. But, though similar,
they are rarely identical. The time has been long enough
for some but not very great divergent modification. It
is impossible to conceive a more beautiful illustration of
the principles we have been trying to enforce.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Thus, then, undoubtedly all the phenomena of geographical
distribution of species are most rationally
explained on the principle of slow evolution&mdash;changes,
different in different places, and increasing with the time
of isolation and its completeness.</p>

<p><b>Objection.</b>&mdash;The only objection which can be raised
against this view is the manner in which contiguous geographical
faunas and floras pass into one another when
they are <i>limited not by barriers but by temperature</i>. In
passing from equator to poles, over continuous land,
we of course pass through many successive faunas and
floras, limited wholly or mainly by temperature. Now, if
species are indeed indefinitely modifiable, then on the borders
of contiguous faunas or floras, where one species disappears
and another closely allied but adapted to a colder
temperature takes its place, the one species (say the anti-evolutionists)
ought to be gradually <i>transmuted</i> into the
other, so that all the gradations may be traced. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
is certainly not usually the fact. On the contrary, a
species may indeed pass out gradually, and another come
in gradually, so far as <i>number and vigor of individuals
are concerned</i>; but, in <i>specific character</i>, they may
be said, usually at least, to come in suddenly, with all
their characters perfect, remain unchanged throughout
their whole range, and pass out suddenly at its borders.
Another species takes its place, overlapping in range and
coexisting on the borders of both; this also continues
unchanged, as far as it goes, and so on. The change
from one fauna to another is apparently not by <i>transmutation</i>
of one species <i>into</i> another by gradations, but by
<i>substitution</i> of one perfect species <i>for</i> another perfect
species. As a broad general statement, the condition of
things is precisely such as would be the case if specific
types were substantially immutable by physical conditions,
but were originated in some inscrutable way
(created) in the regions where we now find them, and
have spread in every direction as far as physical conditions
and struggle with other species would allow them&mdash;their
ranges therefore interpenetrating and overlapping
one another on their borders.</p>

<p>Two characteristic examples will make our meaning
clear. There is not a more characteristic tree known
than the sweet-gum, or liquidambar. This tree grows
from the borders of Florida to the shores of the Great
Lakes. It may indeed be most numerous and vigorous
somewhere in the middle region, and may die out gradually
in number and vigor of individuals on the borders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of its range, but in specific character it is substantially
the same throughout, easily recognizable by its dense
wood, its winged bark, its five-starred leaf, its spinous
burr, and its fragrant gum. Physical conditions may
diminish its number and vigor, and limit its extension,
but seem powerless to essentially modify its specific character.
It seems to give up its life rather than change
its nature.</p>

<p>Another striking example: The sequoias (redwood
and big-tree) are entirely confined to California, and
there are only two species now existing, viz., the redwood
(<i>S. sempervirens</i>) of the Coast Ranges, and the big-tree
(<i>S. gigantea</i>) of the Sierra Nevada. Doubtless they are
most numerous and vigorous somewhere in the middle
of their range, and die out gradually in number and
vigor on the borders north and south, being replaced
there by other genera better adapted to the physical
conditions; but in specific character they remain essentially
unchanged throughout. They are everywhere
the same&mdash;easily recognizable by wood, bark, leaf, and
burr. Both in this case, and in the previous one of
the sweet-gum, it is as if they were created perfect in
their present localities, and have spread in all directions
as far as physical conditions and the struggle with other
competing species would allow; but physical conditions
seem powerless to change them into any other species
by adaptive modification.</p>

<p><b>Answer.</b>&mdash;We have, we believe, stated the objection
fairly. The answer is, that the elements of <i>time</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of <i>migrations</i> have not been taken into the account. In
fact, this objection was conceived and formulated before
the idea of geological time was fully assimilated by the
human mind, and our theories of origin adjusted to it.
If these species did indeed originate where we now find
them, and <i>in the present geological epoch</i>, the argument
might at least be entertained; but this is not the fact.
We know something of the geological history of all
these species, and the history of the migrations of some
of them. We know that sweet-gums were abundant
and of <i>many species</i> in the United States in Tertiary
times, and all have become extinct except this remnant.
Whatever of modifications there were must be looked
for at or about the time of its origin in Tertiary times,
not now. Species, like individuals, are plastic only
when young. This one has already become rigid, and
all the more so as it is a remnant widely separated from
other species. For competition is strongest and most
effective with nearest allies. Present species are mostly
isolated remnants&mdash;terminal twiglets of the tree of life.
Twiglets are of course widely separated at their visible
ends. Their points of union with other twiglets must
be sought below.</p>

<p>In the case of the sequoias, we know something also
of the history of their migrations. In Miocene times
they were abundant, and of many species in circumpolar
regions. Some twenty-four species of fossil sequoias
are known, fourteen of which are Tertiary. By the
cold of the Glacial epoch they were driven slowly southward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
both in America and in Europe&mdash;in America as
far as Southern California. After the Glacial epoch, and
the return of temperate conditions, they doubtless attempted
to go northward again; but these great changes
were too much for them; they were wholly exterminated
in Europe, and nearly so in America. A few were left
stranded high up on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada,
and on the cool, moist slopes of the Coast Ranges. The
species now in California are not identical with those
found in the Miocene strata of Greenland; but the
difference is only what we might expect after such extensive
migrations and such long and severe struggle
for life. Further, it is noteworthy that the Miocene
species fall into two groups, viz., the yew-like leaved
and the cypress-like leaved. These are represented to-day
in California, the one by the redwood, the other
by the big-tree. They are evidently direct descendants
of the Miocene species, though somewhat modified.</p>

<p>But it will be objected that there ought to be some
cases of transitional forms showing transmutation&mdash;in
fact, there ought to be some cases of species now forming
under our eyes. There are, we believe, examples
of such cases. But intermediate forms are not likely
to be maintained long, especially if migrations occur
to give rise to severe conflict of forms. In that case
the intermediate forms are soon eliminated, and species
become distinct. This important point will be discussed
more fully in the next chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROOFS FROM VARIATION OF ORGANIC FORMS, ARTIFICIAL
AND NATURAL.</span></h2>

<p>As already stated, <a href="#Page_40">page&nbsp;40</a>, the use of the method
of experiment in the field of biology is, unfortunately,
very limited. Nevertheless, it is already beginning to
be used more and more in the department of physiology,
and may be used also, to a limited extent, in
the department of morphology. It is true that direct
<i>scientific</i> experiments, for the express purpose of producing
permanent modifications of form, and thus testing
the theory of evolution, are of comparatively little
value as yet, because the all-important element of time
is wanting. The steps of evolution are so slow, and
the time necessary to produce any sensible effect is usually
so great, that, in comparison, man’s individual
lifetime is almost a vanishing quantity. But, from
time immemorial, experiments have been <i>unconsciously</i>
made by man on domestic animals and food-plants,
which bear directly on this subject. All domestic animals
and food-plants, and many ornamental flowering
plants, have been subjected for ages to a process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
artificial selection acting upon natural variation of offspring.
As wild species are modified, we believe, indefinitely
by divergent variation and <i>natural</i> selection,
so domestic species are modifiable certainly largely,
perhaps indefinitely, by divergent variation and <i>artificial</i>
selection by man. We all know the extraordinary
modifications which have thus been gradually brought
about in domestic animals, such as dogs, horses, sheep,
pigeons, etc.; in food-plants, as cereal grains, garden-vegetables,
etc., and in ornamental plants, as roses,
dahlias, pinks, etc. We can only give very briefly the
principles of the process by which these extreme modifications
are produced, referring the reader to works
specially devoted to this subject for more complete accounts.</p>

<p>Let it be borne in mind, then (<i>a</i>), that inheritance
is not only from the immediate parents, but from the
whole line of ancestry. The inheritance from the immediate
parents is, doubtless, usually greater than from
any other <i>one</i> term of the ancestral series&mdash;the effect
on the offspring of any previous generation becomes,
doubtless, less and less as the distance from the offspring
increases&mdash;yet the <i>sum</i> of the ancestral inheritance
is far greater than the immediate parental. Let
it also be borne in mind (<i>b</i>) that true breeding from
one form for many generations creates a fund of heredity
in that form, and thus tends to produce fixity,
rigidity, or permanence in that form.</p>

<div id="Fig_68" class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;"><img src="images/fig-68.jpg" width="411" height="116" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></div></div>

<p>Now, the method of producing artificial breeds, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
consciously, sometimes unconsciously, is, briefly,
as follows: Suppose it be desired to obtain a variety
of an animal, say a dog, having a certain character.
We start from a common type, <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). If this type
were allowed to breed naturally, the slight divergent
variation of offspring represented by the radiating lines
would neutralize one another by interbreeding, the individual
differences would be “<i>pooled</i>” in a common
stock, and the species would remain substantially constant.
But if among all these slightly divergent varieties
we select one, <i>b</i>, which seems in the right direction,
and ruthlessly destroy all the others (indicated by
crossing them out by the circular line), and breed this
variety, <i>b</i>, only, we shall get again a number of divergent
varieties. It may be that the larger number
of these will be backward, in the direction of the original
type <i>a</i>, on account of the ancestral heredity in
that direction, but some will again be in the desired
direction. Let all the varieties other than the desired
one, but especially the backward-going or reverting
ones, be again destroyed, and the one kind only selected
which seems to be in the right direction, viz., <i>c</i>. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
we push the form thus from generation to generation
in the desired direction, especially if we attempt to
hasten too much the process, the resistance to movement&mdash;if
I may use the expression&mdash;in that direction
becomes greater and greater (shown by the decreasing
distances between the successive points of divergence,
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, etc.), and the tendency to reversion becomes
stronger (shown by the greater number and length of
the backward-going lines), until finally it is almost
impossible to push any farther. We will suppose that
<i>x</i> is such a limit. But if, now, we breed true on the
point <i>x</i>, destroying the reversions or backward variations
for many generations, we will gradually accumulate
a fund of ancestral heredity on this point which
increases with every added generation, until finally the
tendency to reversion becomes small. The variety
<i>breeds true</i> without further interference, or with only
very general superintendence. Such a permanent variety
is called a <i>race</i>. After a race is firmly established
for a sufficient length of time, and the tendency to
reversion is lost, it may itself become a new point of
departure for the formation of new varieties or races,
in the same or other directions. Thus, during even the
brief history of man, have been formed races of the
different domestic animals, and useful and ornamental
plants, differing so greatly from each other that, if found
in the wild state, they would unhesitatingly be called
different species, or even in some cases different genera.</p>

<p>Now, if art can vary form so greatly, and in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
short time, why may not Nature in limitless time? If
art by artificial selection, why not Nature by natural
selection? Nature is as rigid in selection and as ruthless
in destruction: why may we not expect similar or
even much greater results? The process is similar in
the two cases&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., selection among varieties in offspring,
only that the selection is natural instead of
artificial, and the process is so slow that there is little
tendency to reversion in the latter case. Suppose,
then, we have a gradually changing physical environment,
or climate. Among the divergent varieties of
any species in each generation, those would be preserved
which are most in accordance with the new
climate, and the others would perish. This is natural
selection, or survival of the fittest. Add to this the
effect of the change in the organic environment. All
species are modified by the changing physical environment;
but these modified species again all affect one
another in the competitive struggle for life, and the
strongest or swiftest, or most cunning, survive (natural
selection). Add to this, again, the struggle among
the males for possession of the females&mdash;for reproductive
opportunities&mdash;by which only the strongest and most
courageous, or the most beautiful and attractive, leave
progeny which inherit their peculiarities (sexual selection).
Add to these, finally, <i>migrations</i>, voluntary
among higher and involuntary dispersals among lower
animals and plants, and the consequent mingling of
faunas and floras&mdash;the migrations subjecting them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
great change of environment, both physical and organic,
and the mingling producing fiercer struggle for
life&mdash;and we have in powerful operation many causes
of modification. Add, I say, all these causes of modification
together, and then make the process slow and
continuous through unlimited time, and where is the
limit to the degree of change? Commencing in any
species, from any point of departure, there are formed
first slight modifications which would be called varieties;
then these modifications, continuing in the same
direction, form races; these races by wider separation
become species, and species in their turn become genera,
etc. Comparing, again, to a growing tree, varieties
are swelling buds; when they grow into twigs,
they are species; when they branch again into different
species, the branching stem becomes a genus, etc.</p>

<p>We have thus far spoken only of the various forms
of one factor, viz., the Darwinian factor of selection,
whether natural or artificial. We have dwelt upon this
one, because the natural and the artificial processes are
so similar, and the artificial is so controllable. But there
are other factors in operation, in art as well as in nature.
We have already spoken (<a href="#Page_73">p.&nbsp;73</a>) of other factors
of natural change. We have shown how changing
physical environment affects <i>function</i>, and function
affects <i>form and structure</i>, and how these slight
changes are integrated by heredity through many generations.
We have also shown how <i>use</i> or <i>disuse</i> increases
or diminishes the size and change the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
parts, and these changes, also, however slight, are integrated
by heredity.</p>

<p>Now, these factors are operative also in domestication
of animals and cultivation of plants. No environment
is so new and peculiar as domestication and cultivation.
The soil and temperature in plants, food and housing of
domesticated animals, tend to change form and structure
of the offspring, although in a way which it is difficult
intelligently to control, and thus are prolific of varieties
from which to select. In fact, they often give rise to
great and unexpected modifications, called sports, which
form points of departure for new varieties and races.
Now, in nature, not only are all these causes and factors
of change in constant operation, but they act together in
a peculiarly complex way. All the members of a fauna
and flora, and the physical environment of any locality,
constitute together a most complex and delicately adjusted
system of correlated parts. A change in one part
is propagated through the whole system; also, a change
in one factor affects all other factors. When we add to
this the large amount of time, in comparison with individual
human life and observation, necessary to produce
visible change of form, we can easily understand why the
process is still imperfectly understood, although the <i>fact</i>
is certain.</p>

<p>But it will be asked, Are there, then, no differences
between the artificially made extreme varieties equivalent,
so far as difference of form is concerned, to species,
and real natural species? There are. If there were not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
there would never have been any doubt about the derivative
origin of natural species. But if it be asked, Are
not these differences fundamental, and therefore fatal to
the argument for evolution derived from this source?
we answer, we think not. We will deal frankly and
fairly with these differences.</p>

<p><b>First Difference, Reversion.</b>&mdash;The strong tendency
of artificial varieties to reversion, even during the process
of formation, and especially their complete reversion to
the original type if the hand of man be withdrawn&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
if left to themselves, or become wild&mdash;is supposed to show
an essential difference between such varieties, however
extreme, and true species&mdash;is supposed, in fact, to prove
an indestructible permanency of specific types. Nature
disowns these artificial forms, and as it were brands them
with bastardy. Not only so, she strives ever to destroy
them. The supporting hand of man is necessary to
sustain them. Left to themselves and to Nature, they
quickly revert to the original type. If all the extreme
varieties of dogs, from the greyhound and Newfoundland,
on the one hand, to the terrier and lap-dog on the other,
were turned loose on an isolated island, uninhabited by
man but full of other animals, and left there to shift for
themselves&mdash;and the island were visited again after a
lapse of a hundred or a thousand years&mdash;it is probable
that a uniform species, something like to, though perhaps
not identical with, the wolf, would be found. They
would have reverted to the original or nearly the original
wild type from which they were produced by domestication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
All or nearly all that was done by man would
have been undone by Nature. This reversion is one test
of species.</p>

<p>But the reason of this tendency to reversion is obvious:
First, the time was too short, the rate of change
was too rapid, in the artificial formation of these varieties.
There was not time enough to accumulate a fund of heredity
on each successive stage of the change. Therefore
the form is unstable and the tendency to revert is strong.
Compare the fleeting days and the hurrying impatience
of man with the infinite time and the divine patience of
Nature! But mere instability is not the principal cause
of reversion. Secondly, in the case of artificial forms in
a wild state, <i>natural selection compels reversion</i>. Every
species in a wild state must of course be in harmony with
the environment. But artificially made forms are in
harmony with the artificial environment of domestication,
but not with the environment of nature. In nature
the fittest survive, but artificial breeds are not fit to survive
in a state of nature. They are therefore quickly
destroyed in the struggle for life, or must be modified.
Nature immediately begins to select the fittest, and
gradually in the course of time produces one or more
uniform species, similar to that from which they came,
or perhaps to what they would have been by this time if
left to the operation of natural causes under the conditions
supposed. But natural species, if they are formed,
as the derivationists suppose, by the operation of natural
causes, can not revert unless the conditions revert; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the same causes which operated to produce, still continue
to operate to keep, the species. Take an example:</p>

<p>The form, the habits, and the instincts of the pointer
have been made by a slow process of artificial selection
of divergent varieties of offspring, and by training of
individuals continued and its effects accumulated through
many generations. But this form and these habits and
instincts, so laboriously produced, would be quickly destroyed
by Nature. The pointer, left to himself, must
either change or become extinct, because not adapted
to the wild state. Such instincts and habits would
not only be of no use, but would be incompatible with
success in the struggle for life. But suppose for a moment
that these habits and instincts were useful to
the animal in a wild state; evidently they would be instantly
seized upon by natural selection, and not only
perpetuated but intensified until a very distinct species
would be produced. The same is true of all other races
of dogs. If the Newfoundland, the greyhound, and the
pug were all turned loose in a forest, and if each of these
kinds were admirably adapted to some place in the economy
of Nature&mdash;for some special mode of food-getting
without corresponding disabilities in other directions (as
must be the case if made by natural selection)&mdash;there can
be no doubt they would each survive, and their characters
intensified; intermediate forms would disappear (for
reasons which we shall see presently), and we would soon
have three distinct species, or perhaps we would even
call them distinct genera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
<b>Second Difference, Intermediate Forms.</b>&mdash;Natural species
are distinct&mdash;marked out with hard and fast lines&mdash;while
artificially-made races, even though in their typical
forms they differ as much or more than natural species,
shade into one another by insensible gradations. In answer
and explanation of this difference we remark: If
species or modified forms of any kind, whether natural
or artificial, are made by natural causes, and not at once
out of hand by supernatural creation, then of course
there must have been gradations in the process of making.
Now, in the artificial case, the whole process as
well as the result lies within the limits of observation,
while in the natural case only the final result. But it
will be asked, Why are the gradations not seen also in
the final result? We answer, because the intermediate
forms are eliminated in the struggle for life, and not reproduced
by cross-breeding. If artificial races always
bred true&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., without crossing, as natural species do&mdash;they
would probably soon be as sharply demarked. Cross-breeding
is the great cause of the shadings between domestic
races. This brings me to the third and most important
difference.</p>

<p><b>Third Difference, Cross-Fertility.</b>&mdash;Artificially-made
races breed freely and without repugnance with one another,
and the offspring of such cross-breeding is indefinitely
fertile. Natural species will not usually unite
with one another, being prevented by sexual repugnance
and other causes. Or, if they do sexually unite, there
is either no offspring, or else the offspring is sterile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
and therefore the intermediate form dies out in the
first generation; or else the offspring is imperfectly
fertile, and therefore the intermediate form is eliminated
in a few generations, and the species remain
distinct; or else the offspring is more fertile with the
parent stocks, and therefore revert to the parent stocks,
and still the species remain distinct. Such infertile, or
imperfectly fertile, offspring&mdash;the result of crossing of
species&mdash;are called hybrids.</p>

<p>This is regarded as a most important test of true
species, as contrasted with varieties or races. There
are two bases on which species may be founded. Species
may be based on <i>form</i>, morphological species; or
they may be based on <i>reproductive functions</i>, physiological
species. By the one method a <i>certain amount
of difference</i> of form, structure, and habit, <i>constitutes
species</i>; according to the other, if the two kinds breed
freely with each other and the offspring is indefinitely
fertile, the kinds are called varieties, but if they do
not they are called species. The two tests, however,
do not always accord. Every now and then we find
undoubted morphological species which may be crossed
and produce indefinitely fertile offspring. Yet it is
certainly true that species are usually cross-sterile, while
varieties, whether natural or artificial, are cross-fertile.</p>

<p>In explanation of this important difference, let it
be observed that there are here two things which must
be kept distinct in the mind, although they are, doubtless,
closely allied&mdash;viz., sexual repugnance (psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
element) and cross-sterility (physiological element).
The former is found, of course, only in the higher
animals, where fertilization is <i>voluntary</i>. The latter is
universal among all living things. This latter, therefore,
is the more fundamental and essential element,
and the former may be regarded as its psychical sign
in the higher animals. It is of this latter, therefore&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
cross-sterility&mdash;that we shall speak mainly.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, we have growing together in the same
locality many species of pines or oaks, or other anemophilous
trees. The whole air is filled with the pollen
of many species, and every germ-cell must receive many
kinds of male cells, and yet there are no hybrids, but,
on the contrary, the species remain distinct. So also
in case of hermaphrodite animals, where the fertilization
is involuntary; many aquatic species are found together
in the same locality, and the water is filled with sperm-cells
of many different species. Many kinds of sperm-cells
must fall on each germ-cell, and yet there are no
hybrids; the species remain distinct. In all such cases
we must suppose that there is, among the different kinds
of male cells, a struggle for the possession of the germ
or female cell, or a sort of sexual selection by the female
cell among the competing male cells, and the fittest&mdash;the
most in accord; i.&nbsp;e., those of the same species&mdash;prevail.
This is universal. But in the higher animals,
in addition to the prepotency of male cells of the
same species, and comparative infertility in case of union
of those of different species, sexual attraction and sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
repugnance contribute to the same result, and species
are thus doubly separated. Thus sexual selection is of
two kinds: selection of individuals for union (psychical),
and selection of sperm-cells for fertilization (physiological).
The one kind is usually the sign of the other&mdash;attraction
the sign of fertility, and repugnance of sterility.</p>

<p>But in the domestic state it is all otherwise. Free
competition between individuals or between cells is not
allowed. Thus, for example, among plants, crossings
may be forced and hybrids made in gardens which would
never occur in Nature. The florist prevents fertilization
in the same kind and compels fertilization of a different
kind. If male cells of the same kind were allowed to
compete, the result would be different. Doubtless the
same method would succeed in many lower animals.
So also in higher animals free competition and sexual
selection for union are often not allowed, and therefore
animals of different species, such as the horse and the
ass, unite, which would not do so if they were free to
select as in the wild state. These two are widely distinct
species, sometimes even called genera, and therefore
the offspring is infertile; but two closely allied
species, such as two species of wolf, or of the fox, in a
domestic state would probably not only unite but produce
indefinitely fertile offspring. In fact, it is almost
certain that the dog was made by a mixture of several
species of wolf, most, perhaps all, of them now <span class="locked">extinct.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
On the other hand, it is not at all certain that the
extreme varieties of dogs have not passed the limit of
greatest attraction, and therefore of greatest cross-fertility,
and that, if allowed free choice, as in Nature,
they would not breed true, or tend to breed true, with
their own kind, and intermediate kinds die out in the
struggle for life.</p>

<p><b>Law of Cross-breeding.</b>&mdash;Before going any further in
this discussion, it is necessary to bring out another
point of extreme importance in the formation of varieties,
both natural and artificial&mdash;a point which I believe
throws light upon the very significance of sex
itself&mdash;I refer to the effect of cross-breeding.</p>

<p>It is a curious and most significant fact that different
varieties, both natural and artificial, are, up <i>to
a certain limit</i>, not only cross-fertile and cross-attractive,
but even more so than individuals of the same
variety. Long experience has shown that very close
breeding of the same variety for a long time fixes the
<i>kind</i> but <i>weakens</i> the <i>stock</i>, especially in fertility, while
judicious crossing of varieties strengthens the stock,
increasing its fertility, and especially producing <i>plasticity</i>
or <i>variability</i>. Therefore breeders, if they wish
to preserve a valuable variety, breed close; but, if they
wish to make new varieties, cross-breed. But we have
already seen that species are usually cross-sterile. Therefore
there must be some regular law of increase to a
maximum, and again decrease to zero. It is this law
that I now wish to investigate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
In the lowest animals and plants multiplication of
individuals and the continuance of the kind are independent
of sex, and therefore in such there may be no
sex at all. The sexual elements are not yet differentiated.
An individual divides itself into two; each
grows to the original size and again divides into two,
and so on, it may be indefinitely. In this lowest form
of reproduction the individual is sacrificed to the kind,
or else we may regard the kind as an extension of the
individual, and reproduction as a modification of growth.
But there are other sexless modes of reproduction, found
in nearly all plants and many lower animals, in which
the individuality is not sacrificed. The next step in
the ascending scale is reproduction by <i>budding</i>. In
this case a bud is formed which grows into a perfect
individual, and may remain attached to the parent
stalk, forming together a compound individual, as in
most plants and many lower animals, such as the coral;
or it may separate and assume independent life, as in
some plants and many lower animals. In still other
animals, as in many hydrozoa, the budding function is
relegated to a special part, which thus becomes a reproductive
<i>organ</i>. The next step is the placing of the
budding organ, for greater safety, in an <i>interior cavity</i>.
This is the case with aphids. Now, why would not
this be an excellent mode of reproduction for all animals,
man included? Why was sex introduced at all?
There are very sufficient reasons, of many kinds, which
may come up later; but the fundamental reason, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
connection with evolution, is <i>the funding of individual
differences in a common offspring, thereby giving to the
offspring a tendency to divergent variation</i>.</p>

<p>Now, <i>non-sexual</i> reproduction is <i>absolute true breeding</i>.
The law of like producing like is absolute. Heredity
is all-powerful, and tendency to variation is <i>nil</i>.
These modes of reproduction are in fact but a modification
of growth and an extension of the individual. Evolution-changes
in animals produced in this way only
must be very slow, since the most powerful factor of
evolution, viz., natural selection among divergent varieties
of offspring, would be wanting. In the earliest times,
therefore, before sex was yet declared, we may imagine
that physical environment was the great and only factor
of change. Sexual reproduction introduces the new element
of variation of offspring from which Nature makes
her selections; and this element of variation is apparently
the result of the union of <i>diverse</i> individuals, and
the funding of these differences in a common offspring,
and thus a double inheritance of individual characteristics
from the parents and a multiple inheritance of the
same from the ancestry. See, then, with this end in view,
the pains Nature has taken to make the difference between
the uniting individuals and the diversity of inheritance
by the offspring as great as possible, and yet the
gradual way in which she has accomplished it. As already
said, the lowest form of reproduction is that by
<i>fission</i>. Next comes budding in <i>any</i> part indifferently.
Next comes the relegation of the budding function to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
particular part. This is the first appearance of a reproductive
<i>organ</i>. Next comes the placing of this organ,
for greater safety, within. Thus far all is non-sexual
reproduction&mdash;all a modification of growth&mdash;an extension
of the individual, like the propagation of plants by cuttings
and by buds. Then comes sexual reproduction in
its lowest forms.</p>

<p>It may be well to stop here, to show the entire difference
between this and non-sexual modes. The latter, we
have seen, is only a modification of growth, an extension
of the individual. Now, sexual reproduction is the opposite
of all this. Growth is a constant multiplication
of cells. One cell is ever becoming two similar cells&mdash;or,
if we call them individuals, one individual is ever becoming
two similar individuals. But in sexual reproduction
we have an exactly reverse process. Reduced to its simplest
terms, sexual reproduction is the fusion of <i>two diverse</i>
cells, sperm-cell and the germ-cell, to form <i>one</i> cell,
the ovule&mdash;literally, a diverse twain forming one flesh.
In its higher forms it is the union of diverse <i>individuals</i>
to bring about the same result. Instead of one cell becoming
two, it is two cells becoming one; instead of one
individual becoming two in the offspring, it is two individuals
becoming one in the offspring. But this great
change was not brought about at once, but only in the
most gradual manner. First, the sexual elements&mdash;sperm-cell
and germ-cell&mdash;are separated, but <i>in the same organ</i>.
Then the organs&mdash;spermary and ovary&mdash;are separated,
but in the <i>same individual</i>. This is the condition of self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>fertilizing
hermaphroditism so common among plants
and lower animals. Then comes cross-fertilizing hermaphroditism;
and Nature takes much pains and uses
many ingenious devices to prevent self-fertilization and
insure cross-fertilization. Now, for the first time, we
have slight individual differences funded in a common
offspring. Then, in order to absolutely forbid self-fertilization,
and at the same time allow greater differences in
the crossing individuals than could be attained in hermaphroditic
individuals, the sex organs are separated in
<i>different individuals</i>, and fertilization can only take
place by <i>voluntary union</i>. Then, to insure the union of
suitable individuals, and forbid the ban between unsuitable,
there are introduced sexual attraction and repulsion.
Then, last of all, the difference between the two sex-individuals
becomes greater and greater as we go up. It
is conspicuous only in vertebrates and some insects, and
very conspicuous only in birds and mammals.</p>

<p>We see, then, as we go up the taxonomic, and undoubtedly
also the phylogenic series, that there is a cross-breeding
of more and more diverse individuals, a funding
of more and more divergent characteristics in a common
offspring. Why is this? I answer, for the sake of <i>better
results in the offspring</i>. This is abundantly shown
by direct experiment. In hermaphroditic plants in which
there may be either self-fertilization or else cross-fertilization
with other individuals of the same species, the latter
produces better results in number and vigor of offspring.
But there are other advantages, more difficult to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
but none the less certain, and of the greatest importance
in evolution: First, as already stated, complexity of inheritance,
like complexity of composition in a chemical
substance, gives instability to the embryo, and thus liability
to variation in the offspring; and this in its turn
furnishes the material for selection of the fittest. Again,
it seems to me that there is a direct tendency to improve
the offspring by a sort of struggle in the embryo among
the various qualities inherited from both sides, and a
survival of the best and strongest&mdash;a sort of pre-potency
of strong qualities.</p>

<p>Can divergence of uniting individuals and the funding
of diverse characteristics go any further? It may.
The differences of the uniting individual may be still further
increased, and the resulting offspring still further
improved by the cross-breeding of different varieties of
the same species, for we thus add varietal differences to
sexual differences in the uniting individuals. It is well
known that too close breeding, or consanguineous breeding,
or breeding in and in, as it is variously called, if
continued long, has a bad effect on the offspring, weakening
the stock, while judicious crossing of varieties within
certain limits of difference has a good effect, strengthening
the stock and increasing its fertility. It probably
does so in two ways: one direct, by funding many diverse
qualities from both sides, and the survival in the offspring
of the strongest and best; the other indirect, by
giving <i>plasticity</i>, instability to the embryo, and variability
to the offspring, and therefore abundant material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
for the operation of selection, either by man or by Nature.
We said, “within certain limits of difference.” If
the difference is extreme, as in extreme varieties and
races, then the effect becomes again bad, and more and
more so as the limit of specific difference is approached;
at which limit at last Nature shuts down and forbids the
bans. Thus, then, there is in cross-breeding a regular law
of effect, increasing to a maximum and again decreasing,
which may be graphically represented by a curve (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig.&nbsp;69</a>).
In this figure the horizontal line represents the ordinary
level of the type; distances on this line represent
differences, individual, varietal, or specific; ordinates
above or below represent the effect, good or bad, of crossing.
Thus s s′ represent two species, and the line between
represents their specific differences; <i>r r′</i> represent different
races or permanent varieties; <i>v v′</i> two strong varieties;
<i>d d′</i> ordinary individual differences; <i>c c′</i> close resembling
or consanguineous individuals. The undulating line represents
the effect of crossing these various kinds. It is
seen that “in-and-in breeding,” <i>c c′</i>, produces bad effect
(negative ordinates); breeding of ordinary individual
differences, <i>d d′</i>, keeps the stock at the ordinary level&mdash;in
its typical form; crossing two strong varieties, <i>v v′</i>, produces
maximum good effect (positive ordinates); crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
decided races produces again bad effects, which become
infinitely bad as we approach species, <span class="smcap smaller">S S′</span>.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<div id="Fig_69" class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;"><img src="images/fig-69.jpg" width="434" height="88" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></div></div>

<p>It is generally admitted that long-continued very close
breeding has a bad effect. Even in plants, Darwin has
shown that cross-fertilization has better effect than self-fertilization,
this last being of course the closest possible
breeding. But it is probable that the principal bad effect
is not on the stock but <i>on the process of evolution</i>. Very
close breeding weakens the stock, ordinary breeding of
individual differences maintains the stock at the ordinary
level and fixes it. Cross-breeding of varieties
strengthens the stock, and also (and this is its main
advantage) produces plasticity in the stock, gives rise to
strong divergent variations, or even sports, and thus becomes
a main agent in evolution. It is probable, moreover,
that the higher the function the more sensitive is it
to these effects of breeding. Therefore, the effect is greater
in man than in any other animal. It is true that many
have doubted the bad effect of close breeding in man,
and have brought forward formidable statistics to substantiate
their position; but these doubtless take no account
of the most important function, the psychic, and especially
the most important element in every function, so
far as evolution or progress is concerned, viz., <i>plasticity</i>
or capability of progressive improvement. The tendency
of consanguineous breeding, or even the breeding of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
of like character and experiences, as in an isolated
community, is, if not to deteriorate the physique, at least
to fix, stereotype the character, and thus to check social
progress. Contrarily, the crossing of varieties of the
same race seems not only to strengthen but, by the diverse
inheritance, to produce plasticity of character and capacity
for progress. But the difference between the primary
races seems too great for crossing with advantage.
Some degree of sexual repugnance which undoubtedly
exists between the primary races is the psychical sign of
this <span class="locked">fact.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<p>If, now, we go back to what we said before taking up
this subject of the effect of cross-breeding, we at once see
that there is an apparent flaw in all our reasonings. If
close in-and-in breeding produced better and more numerous
offspring than cross-breeding between slight varieties,
then, indeed, such varieties would be preserved,
and increase in divergence from generation to generation
until they became species. Or, in any case, if, in
any way, divergence could reach the point of extreme
varieties or races, or what are called sub-species, then
commencing cross-sterility would complete the separation,
and thus form true species. But how can the process
of progressive divergence begin, when slight varieties
are even more fertile by cross-breeding than by close
breeding? Is it not evident that, with every generation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the slight varieties would cross-breed with one another
and with the parent stock, and thus all varietal differences
would be funded into a common stock, and the
type would be preserved unchanged? This, as already
pointed out (<a href="#Page_76">p.&nbsp;76</a>), has always been the chief difficulty
in the way of imagining how varieties can grow into species;
and the difficulty is <i>only increased</i> by our discussion
of the law of cross-breeding. Now, just here, Dr.
Romanes’s most important and prolific idea comes to our
help, and, as it seems to us, completely solves the difficulty.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Romanes, no organ is so subject
to variation as the reproductive, and this in no respect
so much as in degrees and kinds of fertility&mdash;we might
almost say so subject to freaks of cross-sterility. Now,
suppose we start with any well-defined species in a state
of nature. With every generation there are many
slightly divergent individual varieties, some greater and
some less; but these are all immediately swamped by
crossing with one another and with the parent stock,
and the species remains unchanged. But suppose among
these divergent variations there arise, from time to
time, some which affect the reproductive organs in such
wise that the variety, though perfectly fertile with its
own kind, is infertile, or imperfectly fertile, with other
varieties, and especially with the parent stock. The
change may be only in the <i>time</i> of flowering in plants,
or season of heat in animals, or it may be actual infertility
in sexual union. Right here we have the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
of a new species. The variety is sexually isolated
from the parent stock by cross-sterility, and
therefore all its peculiarities, however trivial, are preserved
by true breeding. Cross-breeding is necessary to
make species, but true breeding preserves them. Cross-breeding
tends ever to make varieties, but immediately
destroys them again. This constant forming and swamping,
separating and again merging of varieties, like
mixing of dough, makes the whole mass (stock) more
and more plastic and subject to variety. This plasticity
finally gives rise to varieties of the kind which
produces species by sexual isolation. By continued
merging the centrifugal forces continually increase, but
are continually repressed by crossing, until finally varieties
break away to form species.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to see, from this point of view, why
artificial varieties are cross-fertile. It is because in
artificial breeding we are intent only on making varieties
in form, size, color, etc., and not at all on making
any characterized by cross-sterility with the parent
stock. Cross-sterility with the parent stock, or with
other varieties, would be of no advantage, because we
control the breeding, and can breed true if we desire.
Sexual isolation is not necessary, because we can use
physical isolation. On the contrary, such cross-sterility
would be a positive disadvantage to the breeder, by
limiting the range of his experiments just where they
would be most prolific in making new varieties. Hence,
as might be expected, all domestic varieties are cross-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>fertile,
unless it be the extreme varieties, which may,
in some instances, have passed the limit of greatest
fertility.</p>

<p>If this idea be true, then species which have originated
in the same locality ought to be always cross-sterile,
but species which have grown up apart, in widely
separated geographical regions, ought to be sometimes
cross-fertile, because they were isolated by physical not
by sexual barriers. Such, Dr. Romanes thinks, is a fact.
It is, however, a very important point, which ought to
be carefully investigated. We say “<i>sometimes</i>.” It is
probable that most geographical species also are cross-sterile;
for, although the isolation by cross-sterility of
slight varieties be the main cause of the origin of species,
yet a species formed by isolation of any other kind
will gradually become cross-sterile with other species.
Although cross-sterility be the main cause of divergence,
yet divergence beyond a certain limit, however caused,
will bring about cross-sterility, because the reproductive
organs will partake of the general change going on in
every part.</p>

<p><b>Application.</b>&mdash;Suppose, then, a species breeding naturally
in a wild state. Individual varieties are constantly
being formed and again funded back into the common
stock by cross-breeding. If the varieties thus formed
be decided, the cross-breeding will strengthen the stock,
and especially will preserve and increase its plasticity or
tendency to variation. Finally, among the widely divergent
varieties there is one affecting the reproductive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
organs of several individuals in such wise that they are
infertile, or imperfectly fertile, with the parent stock,
though perfectly fertile among themselves. These form
a new species, which continue to increase indefinitely.</p>

<p><b>Objection answered.</b>&mdash;This view completes the answer
to an objection which is often made to evolution: “If
natural species are formed by transmutation, why is it
we do not find intermediate links? Why is not organic
nature made up only of individual forms, shading insensibly
into each other in such wise that classification
becomes a mere device to handle more conveniently
complex material? Why is it that groups, especially
species, are marked out with hard and fast lines?”
We have heretofore answered this by saying that intermediate
forms are eliminated. So they are, but how?
Dr. Romanes’s idea of physiological selection largely
answers this. It is by the funding of <i>ordinary</i> varieties
into a common parental stock by crossing, and
separating <i>specific</i> varieties by cross-sterility. Thus the
organic field is broken up into points about which
variations oscillate. As every mass of matter, when
closely examined, is found to consist of aggregations
about centers of <i>cohesive</i> attraction as discrete granules
or crystals, and only exceptionally do we find a homogeneous
vitreous structure; even so organic forms aggregate
about points of <i>sexual</i> attraction, and the whole
mass consists of discrete species, and only exceptionally&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
in domestication&mdash;do we find insensible shadings.
Now, species are the smallest aggregate of individuals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
as granules are of molecules. Species are more
distinctly marked out by hard and fast lines than are
other taxonomic groups only because they are the <i>last</i>,
going downward, that are cross-sterile&mdash;because right
here is the change from cross-sterility to cross-fertility.</p>

<p>If this view be true, then in <i>the same locality</i> species
ought to be always distinct and without shadings.
If we find shadings at all, it ought to be in intermediate
geographical regions, where isolation is not sexual
but physical. Now, this is exactly what we find to be
the fact. <i>Innumerable examples of such intermediate
forms in intermediate geographical regions</i> are now
known, especially among birds and reptiles, and examples
have so increased in modern times, by closer study,
that naturalists, especially ornithologists, have been compelled
to resort to a trinomial nomenclature in order
to designate these geographical <span class="locked">sub-species.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p>If any further explanation is necessary, it will probably
be found in the following suggestions:</p>

<p>1. The number of individual varieties constantly
being formed is almost infinite, but the number of
places in nature is very limited. Now, among the infinite
number of slight individual varieties formed with
every generation, the competitive struggle will be severest
between those most nearly alike, because they are
competitors for the <i>same</i> place. Only one kind succeeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
viz., the fittest. Intermediate forms are, therefore,
exactly those which are eliminated in the most
wholesale way. 2. Add to this the fact that, as soon
as divergence, from whatsoever cause, reaches a certain
point, sexual repugnance or cross-sterility, or both, come
in to perpetuate and increase the separation already
commenced. 3. Add to this, again, that migrations in
higher animals, and involuntary dispersals in lower animals
and in plants, and the mingling together of different
faunas and floras, produces a still fiercer struggle
for life, especially between natives and invaders, and
thus great numbers of forms are destroyed; all but the
fittest are weeded out, and therefore the distinctness of
the remainder is greatly increased. Periods of great
changes of physical geography and of climate, and therefore
of wide and general migrations, are also periods
of great weedings-out of unfit forms. Thus it happens
that existing faunas and floras are little else than isolated
<i>remnants</i>.</p>

<p>To illustrate, again, by a growing tree: If all the
buds of a tree lived and grew, they would soon become
so numerous that they would together form a solid
hemispherical mass, like a coral-head, with no room
between for leaf or light or air. But ninety-nine one-hundredths
of buds die in the struggle for light and
air, and therefore the survivors are distinct growing
points, widely separated from each other. Species are
such extreme, but separated, twiglets of the tree of life.</p>

<p><b>Objection.</b>&mdash;But it will be objected, again: The twig-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span><i>points</i>
are, indeed, separate, but the twigs themselves
must meet somewhere lower down, where they began
to grow. Intermediate links may be wanting <i>now</i>, but
they must, of course, have existed once&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., in previous
geological times, and therefore ought to be found
fossil. In distribution in space or geographically, organic
kinds may be marked off by hard-and-fast lines, but,
if their derivative origin be true, in their distribution
in <i>time</i> or geologically, there ought to be many examples
of insensible shadings between them. In fact, if we
only had all the extinct forms, the organic kingdom,
taken as a whole and throughout all time, ought to
consist not of species at all, but simply of individual
forms, shading insensibly into each other, like the colors
of the spectrum, and our classification ought to be a mere
matter of convenience, having no counterpart in nature.
But this is not the fact. On the contrary, the law of
distribution in time is apparently similar in this respect
to the law of distribution in space, already given (<a href="#Page_169">page&nbsp;169</a>).
As in the case of <i>contiguous</i> geographical faunas,
the change is apparently by <i>substitution</i> of one species
<i>for</i> another, and not by <i>transmutation</i> of one species
<i>into</i> another. So also in <i>successive</i> geological faunas,
the change seems rather by substitution than by transmutation.
In both cases species seem to come in suddenly,
with all their specific characters perfect, remain
substantially unchanged as long as they last, and then
die out and are replaced by others. Certainly this
looks much like immutability of specific forms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
supernaturalism of specific origin. We have, we believe,
satisfactorily explained this in the case of geographical
distribution (<a href="#Page_201">page&nbsp;201</a>), but how can we explain
it in the case of geological distribution?</p>

<p><b>Answer.</b>&mdash;1. The reason for this, given by Darwin
and other evolutionists, is the extremely fragmentary
character of the geological record. If the existing
faunas and floras are but isolated remnants, the rest
having been <i>destroyed</i> by migrations and conflicts, how
much more are fossil faunas and floras but fragmentary
remnants, the rest having been <i>lost</i>, partly because never
preserved, and partly by destruction of the record! If
from this cause existing species are widely separated,
how much more ought we to expect to find fossil species
distinct and widely separated!</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly in most cases a true and sufficient
answer, yet we think the fragmentariness of the
geological record has been overstated. While it is true
that there are many and wide gaps in the record; while
it is true, also, that even where the record is continuous
many forms may not have been preserved, yet there are
some cases, especially in the Tertiary fresh-water deposits,
where the record is not only continuous for hundreds
of feet in thickness, but the abundance of life
was very great, and the conditions necessary for preservation
exceptionally good. In such cases the number
of fossil species found on each horizon seems to be as
great as in existing faunas over equal space. The record
in these cases seems to be continuous and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
break, and crowded with fossil forms; and yet, although
the species change greatly, and perhaps many times, in
passing from the lowest to the highest strata, we do
not usually, it must be acknowledged, find the gradual
transitions we would naturally expect, if the change
were effected by gradual transformations. The incompleteness
of the record, therefore, although a true and
important cause, is not the whole cause.</p>

<p>In further and completer answer to this greatest of
all objections, we will throw out the following suggestions:</p>

<p>2. We must remember that considerable latitude is
allowed by the anti-derivationists to <i>variation of species;</i>
so much so, indeed, that it is often difficult to draw the
line between well-marked varieties and closely-allied species.
Now, according to the derivationist, these strong
varieties, breeding usually true, are naught else than
commencing species.</p>

<p>3. On every side and everywhere, both in existing
faunas and in fossil forms, but especially in the latter,
we find innumerable examples of transitions, or intermediate
forms, between all the <i>higher groups</i>, such as
genera, families, orders, and classes. It is, in fact, by
means of these that the great law of differentiation
from generalized types has been established. It is,
therefore, only between <i>species</i> that such intermediate
forms are rare.</p>

<p>4. But even between species such intermediate forms,
though rare, have been pointed out, both in existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
and in extinct faunas. But the opposition contend that,
in all such cases, the previously supposed species are
only varieties. We have already (<a href="#Page_61">page&nbsp;61</a>) spoken of
the obvious fallacy involved in this position. Species
are first defined as forms distinct and without intermediate
links, and then we are challenged to find such
links; and when, with much labor, we find them, they
say the supposed species are not species, but only varieties.
But there are some cases in which this subterfuge
will not do. There are cases in which the transitions
are between forms so extreme that they can not, by any
stretch of the term, be called varieties. We will select
and dwell upon but one striking example, viz., the fossil
forms of the Tertiary fresh-water deposits of Steinheim.</p>

<p>In Würtemberg, near the little village of Steinheim,
are found certain strata of sand and lime, which are evidently
deposits from a small lake of Tertiary times. The
deposits are extremely rich in fossil shells, especially of
the different species of the genus <i>Planorbis</i>. As the deposits
seem to have been continuous for ages, and the
fossil shells very abundant, this seemed to be an excellent
opportunity to test the theory of derivation. With
this end in view, they have been made the subject of exhaustive
study by Hilgendorf in <span class="locked">1866,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> and by Hyatt in

the species change greatly and many times, the extreme
forms being so different that were it not for the intermediate
forms they would be called not only different
species but different genera. And yet the gradations are
so insensible that the whole series is nothing less than a
demonstration, in this case at least, of origin of species
by derivation with modifications. The accompanying
plate of successive forms (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>), which we take from
Prof. Hyatt’s admirable memoir, will show this better
than any mere verbal explanation. It will be observed
that, commencing with four slight varieties&mdash;probably
sexually isolated varieties&mdash;of one species, each series
shows a gradual transformation as we go upward in the
strata&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., onward in time. Series I branches into
three sub-series, in two of which the change of form is
extreme. Series IV is remarkable for great increase in
size as well as change in form. In the plate we give only
selected stages, but in the fuller plates of the memoir,
and still more in the shells themselves, the subtilest gradations
are found.</p>

<p>This case is striking, partly because it is a very favorable
one, but mainly because it has been so carefully
studied. There can be no doubt that equally careful
study would reveal the same transition in many other
cases. Nor are such transitions confined to the lower
forms of life, though they are probably more abundant
there. According to Cope, the nicest gradations may be
traced between some of the extinct mammalian species
so abundant in the Tertiary deposits of the West&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
between the species of the extinct generalized family
of <i>Oredontidæ</i><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The same is probably true of the
many extinct species of the horse family.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the details of the process
of change in the forms of <i>Planorbis</i> are in accord
with Dr. Romanes’s views. The change does not seem
to have been uniform but somewhat paroxysmal. The
forms seem to remain stable for a long time, and then a
few break into several different forms, while the more
rigid die out. It is as if cross-breeding had kept the
type true, but at the same time increased its tendency to
variation, until finally one or more varieties became sexually
isolated and thus formed new species.</p>

<p>5. But still the question remains: Why are transitional
forms <i>rare</i> in all cases, especially between species&mdash;so
rare that they are eagerly sought and highly prized?
I believe that the true reason of this is that <i>the steps of
evolution are not always uniform</i>.</p>

<p>Nearly all evolutionists have assumed and even insisted
on uniformity, as the opposite of catastrophism
and of supernaturalism, and therefore as essential to the
idea of evolution. They say that the constancy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
action of the forces of change necessitates the uniformity
of the rate of change. But, in fact, this is not always
nor even usually true. Causes or forces are constant, but
phenomena everywhere and in every department of Nature
are <i>paroxysmal</i>. The forces producing storms and
lightning, and volcanoes and earthquakes, are or may be
constant; yet the phenomena are in the highest degree
paroxysmal. Wherever in nature we have a constant
force and a strong resistance, we find more or less paroxysmal
action. For this reason the wind blows in puffs,
the friction of wind on water produces waves, water running
in small pipes issues in pulses. The reason is obvious,
as may be seen by the following examples: Suppose
lifting forces within the earth are resisted by crust-rigidity.
The forces accumulate uniformly until the
resistance gives way, and suddenly we have an earthquake.
Water running with great resistance in small
pipes is checked, but soon accumulates additional force,
which overcomes the resistance, only to be again checked,
and so on, and therefore runs in pulses. Now, the course
of evolution of the whole earth may be likened to such a
current; there are forces of movement and forces of resistance&mdash;progressive
forces and conservative forces. The
progressive force is accumulative, the resisting force is
constant. Thus, in all evolution or history, whether of the
earth or of society, there are periods of comparative quiet,
during which the forces of change are gathering strength,
and periods of revolution or rapid change, during which
these forces show themselves in conspicuous effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Now, that there have been such periods of rapid revolutionary
change in the history of the earth, there can be
no doubt. The history of the earth is marked by periods
of comparative quiet, during which life was exceptionally
abundant and prosperous, and change of organic
forms slow and uniform&mdash;separated by periods of disturbance,
revolution, rapid changes of physical geography
and climate, and consequently of comparatively rapid
and sweeping changes in organic forms. These form the
division-lines between great eras of the earth’s history,
and are always marked by extensive unconformity of the
strata, showing the changes of physical geography above
spoken of, and by apparently sudden and sweeping
change in life-forms, showing the great changes of climate
and other physical conditions. Unfortunately, in
all cases of unconformity of strata, there is, of course, a
break in the continuity of the record; and when the unconformity
is very general a portion of the record may
be irrecoverably lost. The consequence is, that there is
an apparent break also in the continuity of life-forms. It
looks, at first sight, like wholesale extermination of old
and recreation of new forms. But undoubtedly the break
in the continuity of life is apparent only, as is shown by
the loss in the record. If we could recover the whole
record, as indeed we sometimes do, we should find in all
cases that there is no break in the continuity of evolution,
but only more rapid rate of change at these times.
But to this cause of rapid rate of progress&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., change
of physical environment&mdash;we must add change of organic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
environment induced by the physical. We have already
seen (<a href="#Page_179">p.&nbsp;179</a>) that extensive changes in physical geography
and climate are always accompanied by wide migrations
and dispersals of species, the mingling of faunas
and floras, and the severer struggle for life, and the
sweeping weeding-out of all but the fittest, and the
change of these latter, making them still fitter. These
two causes of rapid change, viz., change of climate and
migrations, together with the loss of record, we believe
completely account for those sweeping changes, not only
of species but even of genera, families, and orders which
characterize the passage from one great era to another.</p>

<p>But this does not yet explain the apparent discontinuity
between <i>consecutive</i> species in the same locality in
continuous, conformable strata, or the rarity of transitional
forms when one species takes the place of another
in an apparently continuous record. In such continuous
deposits the successive faunas do indeed gradate insensibly
into one another, but apparently as in contiguous geographical
regions (<a href="#Page_200">p.&nbsp;200</a>) by substitution, not by transmutation.
How shall we explain this?</p>

<p>On this point I throw out some suggestions: 1. In
the modification of species, too, as well as in other progressive
changes, we may imagine two forces operating,
one progressive, the other conservative&mdash;the one external,
the other internal. The external progressive force consists
of all the factors of change already mentioned, the
internal conservative is the law of heredity, of like producing
like. A changing environment tends continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and increasingly to change of organisms, but change is
resisted by heredity, which tends to adhere, within narrow
limits, to the same form. But since the external force
or tendency to change increases constantly&mdash;since
the discord between the environment and the organism
becomes ever greater, there must come a time when either
the species is destroyed, or else the resistance of heredity
gives way, and rapid change takes place. The alternative
is presented to the species to transform or perish; and in
one or perhaps in two or three generations we have an
amount of change which, under other circumstances,
might take a hundred generations to accomplish. These
rapid changes are in fact exactly what in artificial varieties
we call sports. We do not know all the conditions
which determine sports in domestication, and still less
what determines large and widely-divergent variations,
and therefore rapid origin of many divergent species, in
geological history. But one thing seems probable, viz.,
that, when a species begins to change, it continues to
change easily and in many directions. When resistance
gives way it takes some time, many generations, for heredity
to gather force again. Hence, young species are
plastic, fluent, because heredity, on any one point, has
not yet accumulated. But as soon as a stable form is
again reached, then, by accumulating a fund of heredity,
the form tends to become more and more rigid, until
often it becomes too rigid to yield to modifying influences,
and therefore becomes extinct. By far the greater
number of species do thus become extinct and leave no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
progeny, while the few more plastic forms are modified
in several directions, and the number of forms may, after
a little time, be undiminished or even increased.</p>

<p>2. As to the <i>cause</i> of rapid changes of form during
revolutionary or critical periods in the earth’s history,
Brooks has introduced an idea which is very suggestive,
and deserves serious attention. We have above spoken
of the progressive element as external. Brooks regards
both elements as internal, and represented by the two
sexes. The male represents the progressive, the female
the conservative element. The one tends to divergent
variation, the other to fixity of type by heredity. I
think we will all admit that, as a general rule, in man
(and probably all the higher animals) the male is more
highly differentiated into many divergent forms&mdash;the
female is more like the type-form of the species. In
man, the male is certainly more diversified in form, in
expression, and in character. If they have the keenest
ear for musical pitch, they are also most often music-deaf;
if they have the sharpest perception of color, they
are also most often color-blind; if among them we find
the brightest intellects, we also find the dullest and
most stupid; if there are among them more geniuses,
so, also, there are more cranks. The same is also, probably,
true of other animals, in proportion to their grade
of organization. The operation of these two equally
necessary elements is well shown in every advancing
society. The initiative of every movement, in all directions,
good or bad, is determined by the male; the conservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of whatever balance of good there may be,
seems to be mainly by the female. The male tries all
things, the female holds fast that which is good. By
the one society gains a little in each generation; by the
other the gain is conserved and made a new point of
departure. The one is ever building hastily a scaffolding
and platform; the other ever consolidating into a
permanent structure. Now, according to Brooks, what
is true in the plane of social progress is true also in
the lower plane of organic evolution. In sexual union,
and in the resulting offspring, the sperm-cell is the
element which tends to divergent variation, and the
germ-cell to fixity of type, through heredity. In artificial
breeding, then, we ought to make new varieties by
proper use of the sire; we ought to preserve them true
by proper management of the dam.</p>

<p>But, again, it is believed that in many lower animals,
especially insects, the high-feeding of the mother,
and consequent good condition of the ovum, tends to
the production of female offspring. It seems almost
certain that, in butterflies, the sex is not yet declared
in the caterpillar stage. According to the careful experiments
of Mrs. <span class="locked">Treat,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> if the caterpillars be well fed,
they become female butterflies; but, if poorly fed, they
make males. One purpose of this provision of Nature
is, doubtless, to provide for the greater draught on the
vitality of the female in reproduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Now for the application. In good times in the history
of a species, when everything is prosperous, external
conditions are favorable, and food is abundant, females
are in excess, and individuals are greatly multiplied.
Under these conditions, evolution would be slow and
uniform. But in <i>bad</i> times in the history of a species,
when external conditions were unfavorable, not only
would there be excess of males, but these, through the
influence of the changing environment, as well as through
the dominance of the male element, would be more than
usually varied in character. Among the strongly divergent
varieties thus formed, the fittest&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., those most
in accord with the changing environment&mdash;would survive
and leave offspring partaking of their character.
We have already repeatedly said that the severer pressure
of a rapidly-changing environment determines correspondingly
rapid changes in organic forms. It may do
so in many ways; but, according to Brooks, one of the
most important ways is by determining an excess of the
male element.</p>

<p>In brief, then, the causes of rarity of transitional
forms among fossils are&mdash;1. The change being, for the
reasons given, comparatively rapid, the <i>number of generations</i>
between consecutive species are few, perhaps
only one. 2. Times of rapid change are also times of
unfavorable conditions, and therefore the number of
<i>individuals</i> in each generation is small, and all the
smaller&mdash;in Brooks’s view&mdash;because of the fewness of
females. When we remember that fossils are but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
small fraction of the actual faunas and floras of the
time, surely these two causes go far toward explaining
the rarity of links between <i>species</i>. 3. Add to these
the existence of periods of wide-spread changes in physical
geography and climate, and consequent wide migrations
and dispersals of species, and we sufficiently account
for those sweeping changes in species, genera,
families, and orders, which mark the limits of the great
eras, and which are made still more abrupt, and apparently
supernatural, by the loss of record at these <span class="locked">times.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span></p>

<p><b>Objection.</b>&mdash;There is still one more objection which
will be made. We have drawings of plants, animals,
and men, by Egyptian artists, who lived at least three
thousand years ago, and the species of the one and the
races of the other are still the same. Still better, we
have among the wrappings of Egyptian mummies the
very plants themselves, leaves and flowers perfectly
preserved, and even colors almost perfect. Yet the
species are exactly the same as grow in Egypt to-day.
If species are made by gradual transmutation, surely
there ought to have been some change in three thousand
years.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.&mdash;It may be well to note that this apparent
permanence is true of <i>races</i> of men as well as of <i>species</i>
of animals and plants. But the very men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
insist on permanence of species are equally insistent on
the variability of varieties and races. The objection,
therefore, proves too much. We shall not insist on this,
however, because as derivationists we regard races as
naught else than commencing species, and therefore
subject to the same laws. We are not striving for triumph
in debate, but only for truth. The true answer
will, we believe, be found among the following suggestions:</p>

<p>1. Three thousand years seems a long time in human
history, but in geological history it is but a day. This,
the usual answer, is no doubt a true one, but hardly,
we think, sufficient. When we remember the enormous
change which has taken place in faunas and floras since
the end of the Tertiary, if change still continues at the
same rate, surely it ought to be distinctly perceptible
in three thousand years.</p>

<p>2. But we must remember that such changes are
usually more or less paroxysmal; not, indeed, so sudden
as to break the continuity of life, but far more
rapid at some times than at others. The last critical
or revolutionary period of rapid change was the Glacial
epoch. Since that time&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., during the human period&mdash;a
new equilibrium has been established, and the
changes in organic forms have been very slow.</p>

<p>3. Remember, again, that in evolution <i>all</i> species
do not change. On the contrary, most become rigid,
and either remain unchanged, almost indefinitely, or
else die out and leave no descendants. Only the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
plastic forms change into other species, but usually
into several other species, and thus the number of forms
may be undiminished, even though the larger number
of old forms leave no descendants. It is true, therefore,
of this as well as of other epochs, that the greater
number of species are permanent.</p>

<p>4. It is not impossible&mdash;indeed, it is in exact accordance
with the laws of evolution&mdash;that organic forms
are more permanent now than ever before. Evolution
is a growth; the forces of growth must exhaust themselves.
Evolution proceeds by constant differentiation
and specialization, but extreme specialization always
arrests evolution. In ontogenic evolution, for example,
cell-structure becomes more and more specialized, but
also thereby more and more rigid, and, when specialization
is complete, evolution stops, and cell-forms are
permanent. It is this which limits the cycle of every
evolution. So is it precisely with evolution of the organic
kingdom, except that the cycle is much longer.
Here, also, every step is by specialization, and yet specialization
fixes the form, and finally arrests the advance
on that line. Thus, throughout the whole geological
history of the earth, the larger number of forms, by
specialization, become rigid and perish, while the fewer,
more generalized, and more plastic forms take up the
march and carry it forward a step, only to be themselves
specialized and fixed. If we compare, again, to a
tree: each twig finishes its growth, flowers, fruits, and
dies; other buds take up the growth and carry it forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
By specialization the highest condition of a certain
form of life is attained, but other possibilities are
shut off. Extreme specialization is the flowering and
fruiting&mdash;the end and completion of twig-life. Now,
obviously, this specialization and respecialization can
not go on forever. When it is complete in every direction
it must cease, and forms become permanent, or else
perish. When it flowers it must die.</p>

<p>Now, is not the advent of man in many ways a sign
of the completeness of organic evolution? Certain it
is that with man there begins an entirely new form of
evolution. Certain it is that with man evolution is
transferred from the organic to the social plane, from
the material to the psychical. Certain it is that the
forces, the conditions and results of this evolution, are
wholly different from those of the other. In organic evolution
the organism must conform to the environment;
in human evolution the environment is made to conform
to the wants of the organism. The one is unconscious
and involuntary, passive under the dominating laws of
Nature; the other is conscious, voluntary progress toward
an ideal, <i>by the use</i>, among other means, of the laws of
Nature. The one is by change of external form&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
change of species&mdash;the other by change of brain-structure.
Now, does not the commencing of the cycle of
this new evolution imply the closing of that of the old?
The two may overlap somewhat now, but it is evident
that, when the cycle of human evolution culminates,
when highly civilized man shall have taken possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of the whole earth, the whole organic kingdom must
be readjusted to his wants. All organic forms must be
either domesticated or destroyed. Organic forms will
no longer be modified by natural but wholly by artificial
selection.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There are many other supposed objections which have
been urged, but these are mostly not objections to evolution,
but only to some <i>special theory</i> of evolution&mdash;Darwinian,
Spencerian, Lamarckian, or other.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Beauty</b>.&mdash;For example, it has been urged
that natural selection can only account for <i>useful</i> structures;
but <i>beauty</i> is as universal and as conspicuous in
nature as <i>use</i>. In many cases Darwin has shown that
beauty is useful, and in such cases it is, of course,
seized upon by selection and intensified. Thus, the
gorgeous coloring of birds and insects is largely due
to sexual selection. Beauty is attractive, and therefore
the most beautiful prevail in securing reproductive opportunities.
This character is, therefore, perpetuated
in the offspring, and intensified from generation to generation.
But, of course, this can apply only to higher
animals, in which the sexes are separate and sexual
union voluntary. It can not apply to self-fertilizing
hermaphrodites; and yet in these, also, we often find
the most gorgeous coloring. Again, Darwin has very
ingeniously and successfully explained the case of the
beauty and fragrance of flowers of hermaphroditic plants
by another principle, viz., that of <i>insect-selection</i>. Insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
are attracted by the most showy and fragrant
flowers, and thus become the means of carrying pollen
from flower to flower, insuring fertilization, and especially
cross-fertilization. The most beautiful and fragrant
flowers are most certain to be fertilized, and thus
beauty and fragrance become useful to the plant, and
therefore are selected and intensified.</p>

<p>These and many other cases of beauty may doubtless
be explained by showing that it is useful; but beauty
which is without any use can not be explained by natural
selection. Now, as already said, the most gorgeous
beauty is lavishly distributed even among the lowest
animals, such as marine shells and polyps, where no such
explanation is possible. The process by which such
beauty is originated and intensified is wholly unknown
to us.</p>

<p><b>Incipient Organs</b>.&mdash;Again, Mivart has drawn attention
to another difficulty in the way of natural selection as an
explanation even of useful organs. Darwin does not, of
course, attempt to account for the <i>origin</i> of varieties.
As we have already seen, he assumes divergent variation
of offspring as the necessary material on which natural
selection operates. He who shall explain the origin of
varieties will have made another great step in completing
the theory of evolution. But not only does not natural
selection explain the <i>origin</i> of varieties, but neither can
it explain the <i>first steps</i> of advance toward usefulness.
An organ must be already useful before natural selection
can take hold of it to improve it. It can not make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
useful, but only <i>more useful</i>. For example, if fins commenced
as buds from the trunk, it is difficult to see how
they could be of any use, and therefore how they could
be improved by natural selection until they were of considerable
size, and especially until muscles were developed
to move them. Until that time they would seem to be
a hindrance to be removed by natural selection, instead
of a use to be preserved and improved. It would seem
that many organs must have passed through this <i>incipient
stage</i>, in which their use was prospective.</p>

<p>Much that is very interesting might be said on these
and similar points of difficulty, but all this lies entirely
aside from the scope of this work. As already said, these
are not objections to evolution or derivation, but only
to <i>Darwinism</i>, or any other special theory, as a <i>sufficient
explanation</i> of the process of evolution. They only show
that we do not yet fully understand this process; that
there are still other and perhaps greater factors of evolution
than is yet dreamed of in our philosophy.</p>

<p>In the foregoing chapters on special evidences, and
especially in the last two, the reader will observe many
points of doubt, discussion, and difference of opinion.
Let it not be concluded on that account that the <i>law of
evolution</i> is still in the region of uncertainty. It can
not be too strongly insisted on that the fact of evolution
as a universal law must be kept distinct from the causes,
the factors, the conditions, the processes, of evolution.
The former is certain, the latter are still imperfectly understood.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III_I" id="CHAPTER_III_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>

<p>From what has preceded, the reader will perceive
that we regard the law of evolution as thoroughly established.
In its most general sense, i.&nbsp;e., as a law of continuity,
it is a necessary condition of rational thought.
In this sense it is naught else than the universal law of
necessary causation applied to forms instead of phenomena.
It is not only as certain as&mdash;it is far more
certain than&mdash;the law of gravitation, for it is not a contingent,
but a necessary truth like the axioms of geometry.
It is only necessary to conceive it clearly, to accept
it unhesitatingly. The consensus of scientific and philosophical
opinion is already well-nigh, if not wholly,
complete. If there are still lingering cases of dissent
among thinking men, it is only because such do not yet
conceive it clearly&mdash;they confound it with some special
form of explanation of evolution which they, perhaps
justly, think not yet fully established. We have sometimes
in the preceding pages used the words evolutionist
or derivationist; they ought not to be used any longer.
The day is past when evolution might be regarded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
school of thought. We might as well talk of gravitationist
as of evolutionist.</p>

<p>If, then, evolution as a law be certain, if, moreover,
it is a law affecting not only one part of Nature&mdash;the
organic kingdom&mdash;and one department of science&mdash;biology&mdash;but
the whole realm of Nature and every department
of science, yea, every department of thought,
changing our whole view of Nature and modifying our
whole philosophy, the question presses upon us, “What
will be its effect on religious belief, and therefore on
moral conduct?” This is a question of gravest import.
To answer it, however imperfectly, is the chief object of
this work. Except for this, it would probably never
have been undertaken. All that goes before is subsidiary
to this.</p>

<p>But I will doubtless be met at the very threshold by
an objection from the scientific side. Some will say&mdash;because
it is the fashion now to say&mdash;that as simple,
honest truth-seekers, we have nothing to do with its
effect on religion and on life. They say we must follow
Truth wherever she leads, utterly regardless of what may
seem to us moral consequences. This I believe is a grave
mistake, the result of a reaction, and on the whole a
wholesome and noble reaction, against the far more common
mistake of sacrificing truth to a supposed good.
But the reaction, as in most other cases, has gone much
too far. There is a true <i>philosophic</i> ground of justification
for the reluctance with which even honest truth-seekers
accept a doctrine which seems harmful to society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Effect on life is, and ought to be, an important
element in <i>our estimate of the truth of any doctrine</i>. It
is necessary for me to show this, in order to justify this
part of my work.</p>

<p><b>Relation of the True and the Good.</b>&mdash;There is a necessary
and indissoluble connection between truth and
usefulness. We all at once admit this connection in one
direction. We all admit that a truth must eventually
have its useful application. It may not be <i>now</i>, nor in
ten years, nor in a century, nor even in a millennium,
but some time in the future it will vindicate its usefulness.
No truth is trivial or useless in its relation to
human life, for man is a part of Nature, and his life must
be in accordance with the laws of Nature. Every one
admits this, but not every one admits the converse
proposition, viz., that whatever doctrine or belief, in the
long run and throughout the history of human advancement,
has tended to the betterment of our race, must
have in it an element of truth by virtue of which it has
been useful; for man’s good can not be in conflict with
the laws of Nature. Also, whatever in the long run and
in the final outcome tends to the bad in human conduct,
ought to be received, even by the honest truth-seeker,
with distrust as containing essential error. The reason
of this will now be further explained.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Philosophy to Life.</b>&mdash;There are three primary
divisions of our psychical nature, viz., sensuous,
intellectual, and volitional or moral. There are three
corresponding primary processes necessary to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
complete rational and satisfactory philosophy: (1) There
is first the <i>instreaming</i> of the external world through the
senses, as impressions. These we call facts or phenomena.
(2) The elaboration of these facts within, by the <i>intellect</i>,
into a compact, consistent structure. This we call
knowledge. (3) The outgoing of this knowledge by the
<i>will</i> into the world as right or wise conduct. Now these
three are all equally necessary. All these three portions
of our complex nature are equally urgent to be <span class="locked">satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>
But, unfortunately, scientific workers are too apt to
think only 1 and 2 necessary&mdash;that true facts elaborated
into consistent theory are all we need care for. Theologians
and metaphysicians, on the other hand, seem to
think only 2 and 3 necessary. They elaborate a theory
consistent in all its parts, exquisitely woven in beautiful
and delicate pattern, and apparently satisfactory in its
application to the right conduct of life, but are less
careful to inquire whether it is in harmony with facts
derived from the senses. But, we repeat, all three are
equally necessary. The first gathers the materials, the
second constructs the edifice, the third, by <i>use</i>, by practical
application, <i>tests</i> whether it be a fit building to live
in, whether it is constructed on sound architectural principles.
The tendency of the olden time was to neglect
the first, the tendency of the present time is to neglect
the third. But we repeat with stronger emphasis that this
third element is equally necessary. All admit that successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
application in art is the surest test of the truth
of science. Now, social conduct is the art corresponding
to our philosophy of life, and therefore is the sure
test of its truth. It follows, therefore, that unless all
these three primary divisions of our nature are satisfied
by any doctrine, there must result an ineradicable
confusion and discord in our psychical nature, and cordial
acceptance is not only impossible but irrational.
We insist upon this the more because it has become the
fashion in these latter days of dominance of science, to
say that to inquire into effects on society is inconsistent
with the scientific spirit, and unworthy of the honest
truth-seeker. But, observe, I am speaking of effects on
society only as a <i>test of truth</i>. I would not swerve a
hair’s breadth from absolute devotion to truth. It is
necessary, indeed, to inquire into effects on society, but
we must inquire only in the patient spirit characteristic
of the truth-seeker. Whatever is really true will surely
vindicate itself by its beneficence, if we will only wait
patiently for final results. Evolution is no exception
to this universal truth. It will surely vindicate its
beneficence, but we must wait yet a little while&mdash;not very
long.</p>

<p>So much it was necessary to say in justification of the
inquiry which constitutes this third part of our work.
But, after this justification, the question returns with
additional emphasis, “What will be the effect of the
universal acceptance of the law of evolution on religious
thought, and through this on the right conduct of life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
There can be no doubt that evolution, as a law affecting
all science and every department of Nature, must
fundamentally affect the whole realm of thought, and profoundly
modify our traditional views of Nature, of God,
and of man. There can be no doubt that we are now on
the eve of a great revolution. But, as in all great revolutions,
so in this, the first fears as to its effects are
greatly exaggerated. To many, both friends and foes of
Christianity, evolution seems to sweep away the whole
foundation, not only of Christianity, but of all religion
and morals, by demonstrating a universal materialism.
Many are ready to cry out in anguish, “Ye have taken
away our gods, what have we more? Ye have destroyed
our dearest hopes and noblest aspirations, what more
is left worth living for?” But I think all who are at all
familiar with the history of the so-called conflict between
religion and science will admit this is not the first time
this cry has been raised against science. They have
heard this danger-cry so often that they begin to regard
it as little more than a wolf-cry&mdash;scientific wolf in the
religious fold. It may not be amiss, then, to stop a moment
to trace rapidly the main points of this conflict&mdash;to
discuss the various forms of this scientific wolf.</p>

<p>First, then, it came in the form of the <i>heliocentric
theory of the planetary system</i>. We once thought the
earth the center of the universe, and so firm that it can
not be moved. But science shows that it moves about
the sun, and spins unceasingly on its axis. Every one
has heard of the terror of the sheep produced by this discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
and the nearly tragic results to the bold scientist.
But now we look back with wonder that there should
have been any trouble at all. Would any Christian now
consent to give up the grand conceptions of Nature and
of God thus opened to the human mind&mdash;the idea of
infinite space full of worlds, of which our earth is one,
moving in silent harmony as in a mystic dance? Verily,
this wolf has proved itself a harmless, nay, a very noble
beast, and lies down in peace with the lambs.</p>

<p>Next, it came in the shape of the <i>law of gravitation</i>,
as sustentation of the cosmos by law and resident forces.
The effect of this on religious thought was even more
profound, though less visible on the surface, because only
perceived by the most intelligent. It seemed at that time
to remove God from the course of Nature. This was the
real ground of the skepticism of the last century, and
also the real motive of Voltaire’s ardent advocacy of
Newton’s views before these were generally accepted in
France. But now, who would give up this grand idea&mdash;this
conception of law pervading infinite space&mdash;the same
law which controls the falling of a stone guiding also the
planetary orbs in their fiery courses? This is indeed the
divine spheral music, inaudible but to the ear of science,
accompanying the celestial dance.</p>

<p>Next, it came in the form of the <i>antiquity of the earth</i>
and of the cosmos. The earth which we had fondly
thought made specially for us about six thousand years
ago; sun, moon, and stars, which we had vainly imagined
shone only for our behoof&mdash;these, science tells us, existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and each performed its due course inconceivable ages
before there was a man to till the ground or contemplate
the heavens. Some of my readers may still remember
the horror, the angry dispute which followed the promulgation
of these facts. But now, who would consent
to give up the noble conception of infinite time thus
opened to the human mind and become forever the heritage
of man?</p>

<p>Next, it came in the form of the <i>antiquity of man</i>.
It is probable, nay, certain, that man has inhabited the
earth far longer than we had previously supposed we had
warrant for believing. The controversy on this question
and the dread of its result has indeed not yet entirely
subsided. Some timid people still look askance at this
wolf, but I think all intelligent people accept it and find
it harmless.</p>

<p>Next, and last, it comes now in the form of <i>evolution</i>&mdash;of
the origin of all things, even of organic forms, by <i>derivation</i>&mdash;of
<i>creation by law</i>. We are even now in the
midst of the terror created by this doctrine. But what
is evolution but law throughout infinite time? The
same law which now controls the development of an egg
has presided over the creation of worlds. Infinite space
and the universal law of gravitation; infinite time and the
universal law of evolution. These two are the grandest
ideas in the realm of thought. The one is universal sustentation,
the other universal creation, by law. There
is one law and one energy pervading all space and stretching
through all time. Our religious philosophy has long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
ago accepted the one, but has not yet had time to readjust
itself completely to the other. A few more years,
and Christians will not only accept, but love and cherish
this also for the noble conceptions it gives of Nature and
of God.</p>

<p>But some will exclaim, “Noble conceptions of God,
say you! Why, it utterly obliterates the idea of God
from the mind. All other conflicts were for outworks&mdash;this
strikes at the citadel. All others required only readjustment
of claims, rectification of boundaries betwixt
science and religion&mdash;this requires nothing less than unconditional
surrender. Evolution is absolute materialism,
and materialism is incompatible with belief in God,
and therefore with religion of any kind whatsoever!”
Before proceeding any further, it becomes necessary to
remove this difficulty out of the way.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III_II" id="CHAPTER_III_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF EVOLUTION TO MATERIALISM.</span></h2>

<p>It is seen in the sketch given in the previous chapter
that, after every struggle between theology and science,
there has been a readjustment of some beliefs, a giving
up of some notions which really had nothing to do with
religion in a proper sense, but which had become so
<i>associated</i> with religious belief as be to confounded with
the latter&mdash;a giving up of some line of defense which
ought never to have been held because not within the
rightful domain of theology at all. Until the present
the whole difficulty has been the result of misconception,
and Christianity has emerged from every struggle only
strengthened and purified, by casting off an obstructing
shell which hindered its growth. But the present struggle
seems to many an entirely different and far more
serious matter. To many it seems no longer a struggle
of theology, but of essential religion itself&mdash;a deadly
life-and-death struggle between religion and materialism.
To many, both skeptics and Christians, evolution seems
to be synonymous with blank materialism, and therefore
cuts up by the roots every form of religion by denying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the existence of God and the fact of immortality. That
the enemies of religion, if there be any such, should
assume and insist on this identity, and thus carry over
the whole accumulated evidence of evolution as a demonstration
of materialism, although wholly unwarranted,
is not so surprising; but what shall we say of the
incredible folly of her friends in admitting the same
identity!</p>

<p>A little reflection will explain this. There can be no
doubt that there is at present a strong and to many an
overwhelming tendency toward materialism. The amazing
achievements of modern science; the absorption of
intellectual energy in the investigation of external nature
and the laws of matter have created a current in that direction
so strong that of those who feel its influence&mdash;of
those who do not stay at home, shut up in their creeds,
but walk abroad in the light of modern thought&mdash;it
sweeps away and bears on its bosom all but the strongest
and most reflective minds. Materialism has thus become
a fashion of thought; and, like all fashions, must be
guarded against. This tendency has been created and
is now guided by science. Just at this time it is strongest
in the department of biology, and especially is evolution
its stronghold. This theory is supposed by many
to be simply demonstrative of materialism. Once it was
the theory of gravitation which seemed demonstrative of
materialism. The sustentation of the universe by law
seemed to imply that Nature operates itself and needs no
God. That time is passed. Now it is evolution and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
creation by law. This will also pass. The theory seems
to many the most materialistic of all scientific doctrine
only because it is the <i>last</i> which is claimed by materialism,
and the absurdity of the claim is not yet made
clear to many.</p>

<p>The truth is, there is no such necessary connection
between evolution and materialism as is imagined by
some. There is no difference in this respect between
evolution and any other law of Nature. In evolution, it
is true, the last barrier is broken down, and the whole
domain of nature is now subject to law; but it is only
<i>the last</i>; the march of science has been in the same direction
all the time. In a word, evolution is not only
not identical with materialism, but, to the deep thinker,
it has not added a feather’s weight to its probability or
reasonableness. Evolution is one thing and materialism
quite another. The one is an established law of nature,
the other an unwarranted and hasty inference from
that law. Let no one imagine, as he is conducted by
the materialistic scientist in the paths of evolution from
the inorganic to the organic, from the organic to the
animate, from the animate to the rational and moral,
until he lands, as it seems to him, logically and inevitably,
in universal materialism&mdash;let no such one imagine
that he has walked all the way in the domain of science.
He has stepped across the boundary into the domain of
philosophy. But, on account of the strong tendency to
materialism and the skillful guidance of his leaders,
there seems to be no such boundary; he does not distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
between the inductions of science and the inferences
of a shallow philosophy; the whole is accredited
to science, and the final conclusion seems to carry with
it all the certainty which belongs to scientific results.
The fact that these materialistic conclusions are reached
by some of the foremost scientists of the present day
adds nothing to their probability. In a question of science,
viz., the law of evolution, their authority is deservedly
high, but in a question of philosophy, viz.,
materialism, it is far otherwise. If the pure scientists
smile when theological philosophers, unacquainted with
the methods of science, undertake to dogmatize on the
subject of evolution, they must pardon the philosophers
if they also smile when the pure scientists imagine that
they can at once solve questions in philosophy which
have agitated the human mind from the earliest times.
I am anxious to show the absurdity of this materialistic
conclusion, but I shall try to do so, not by any labored
argument, but by a few simple illustrations.</p>

<p>1. It is curious to observe how, when the question
is concerning a work of Nature, we no sooner find out
how a thing is made than we immediately exclaim: “It
is not made at all, it became so of itself!” So long as
we knew not how worlds were made, we of course concluded
they must have been created, but so soon as science
showed <i>how</i> it was probably done, immediately we
say we were mistaken&mdash;they were not made at all. So
also, so long as we could not imagine how new organic
forms originated, we were willing to believe they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
created, but, so soon as we find that they originated by
evolution, many at once say, “We were mistaken; no
creator is necessary at all.” Is this so when the question
is concerning a work of man? Yes, of one kind&mdash;viz.,
the work of the magician. Here, indeed, we believe in
him, and are delighted with his work, until we know
how it is done, and then all our faith and wonder cease.
But in any honest work it is not so; but, on the contrary,
when we understand how it is done, stupid wonder
is changed into intellectual delight. Does it not seem,
then, that to most people God is a mere wonder-worker,
a chief magician. But the mission of science is to show
us how things are done. Is it any wonder, then, that to
such persons science is constantly destroying their superstitious
illusions? But if God is an honest worker, according
to reason&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., according to law&mdash;ought not
science rather to change gaping wonder into intelligent
delight&mdash;superstition into rational worship?</p>

<p>2. Again, it is curious to observe how an <i>old truth</i>,
if it come only in a <i>new form</i>, often strikes us as something
unheard of, and even as paradoxical and almost
impossible. A little over thirty years ago a little philosophical
toy, the gyroscope, was introduced and became
very common. At first sight, it seems to violate all mechanical
laws, and set at naught the law of gravitation
itself. A heavy-brass wheel, four to five inches in diameter,
at the end of a horizontal axle, six or eight inches
long, is set rotating rapidly, and then the free end of the
axis is supported by a string or otherwise. The wheel remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
suspended in the air while slowly gyrating. What
mysterious force sustains the wheel when its only point of
support is at the end of the axle, six or eight inches
away? Scientific and popular literature were flooded
with explanations of this seeming paradox. And yet it
was nothing new. The boy’s top, that spins and leans
and will not fall, although solicited by gravity, so long
as it spins, which we have seen all our lives without special
wonder, is precisely the same thing.</p>

<p>Now, evolution is no new thing, but an old familiar
truth; but, coming now in a new and questionable shape,
lo, how it startles us out of our propriety! Origin of
forms by evolution is going on everywhere about us, both
in the inorganic and the organic world. In its more familiar
forms, it had never occurred to most of us that it
was a scientific refutation of the existence of God, that it
was a demonstration of materialism. But now it is pushed
one step farther in the direction it has always been going&mdash;it
is made to include also the origin of species&mdash;only a
little change in its form, and lo, how we start! To the
deep thinker, now and always, there is and has been the
alternative&mdash;materialism or theism. God operates Nature
or Nature operates itself; but evolution puts no new
phase on this old question. For example, the origin
of the individual by evolution. Everybody knows that
every one of us individually became what we now are by
a slow process of evolution from a microscopic spherule
of protoplasm, and yet this did not interfere with the
idea of God as our individual maker. Why, then, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the discovery that the species (or first individuals of each
kind) originated by evolution destroy our belief in God
as the creator of species?</p>

<p>3. It is curious and very interesting to observe the
manner in which vexed questions are always finally settled,
if settled at all. All vexed questions&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., questions
which have tasked the powers of the greatest minds
age after age&mdash;are such only because there is a real truth
on both sides. Pure, unmixed error does not live to
plague us long. Error, when it continues to live, does
so by virtue of a germ of truth contained. Great questions,
therefore, continue to be argued <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> from
age to age, because each side is in a sense&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., from its
own point of view&mdash;true, but wrong in excluding the
other point of view; and a true solution, a true rational
philosophy, will always be found in a view which combines
and reconciles the two partial, mutually excluding
views, showing in what they are true and in what they are
false&mdash;explaining their differences by transcending them.
This is so universal and far-reaching a principle that I
am sure I will be pardoned for illustrating it in the
homeliest and tritest fashion. I will do so by means
of the shield with the diverse sides, giving the story
and construing it, however, in my own way. There is,
apparently, no limit to the amount of rich marrow of
truth that may be extracted from these dry bones of
popular proverbs and fables by patient turning and
gnawing.</p>

<p>We all remember, then, the famous dispute concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
the shield, with its sides of different colors, which
we shall here call white and black. We all remember
how, after vain attempts to discover the truth by dispute,
it was agreed to try the scientific method of investigation.
We all remember the surprising result. Both
parties to the dispute were right and both were wrong.
Each was right from his point of view, but wrong in
excluding the other point of view. Each was right in
what he asserted, and each wrong in what he denied.
And the complete truth was the combination of the
partial truths and the elimination of the partial errors.
But we must not make the mistake of supposing that
truth consists in <i>compromise</i>. There is an old adage
that truth lies in the middle between antagonistic extremes.
But it seems to us that this is the place of
<i>safety</i>, not of truth. This is the favorite adage, therefore,
of the timid man, the time-server, the fence-man,
not the truth-seeker. Suppose there had been on the
occasion mentioned above one of these fence-philosophers.
He would have said: “These disputants are
equally intelligent and equally valiant. One side says
the shield is white, the other that it is black, now truth
lies in the middle; therefore, I conclude the shield is
gray or neutral tint, or a sort of pepper-and-salt.” Do
we not see that he is the only man who has no truth in
him? No; truth is no heterogeneous mixture of opposite
extremes, but a stereoscopic combination of two surface
views into one solid reality.</p>

<p>Now, the same is true of all vexed questions, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
have given this trite fable again only to apply it to the
case in hand.</p>

<p>There are three possible views concerning the origin
of organic forms whether individual or specific. Two of
these are opposite and mutually excluding; the third
combining and reconciling. For example, take the individual.
There are three theories concerning the origin
of the individual. The first is that of the pious
child who thinks that he was made very much as he
himself makes his dirt-pies; the second is that of the
street-gamin, or of Topsy, who says: “I was not made
at all, I growed”; the third is that of most intelligent
Christians&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., that we were made by a process of evolution.
Observe that this latter combines and reconciles
the other two, and is thus the more rational and philosophical.
Now, there are also three exactly corresponding
theories concerning the origin of species. The first is
that of many pious persons and many intelligent clergymen,
who say that species were made at once by the Divine
hand <i>without natural process</i>. The second is that
of the materialists, who say that species were not made at
all, they were derived, “they growed.” The third is that
of the theistic evolutionists, who think that they were
<i>created</i> by a process of evolution&mdash;who believe that making
is not inconsistent with growing. The one asserts
the divine agency, but denies natural process; the second
asserts the natural process, but denies divine agency; the
third asserts <i>divine agency by natural process</i>. Of the
first two, observe, both are right and both wrong; each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
view is right in what it asserts, and wrong in what it
denies&mdash;each is right from its own point of view, but
wrong in excluding the other point of view. The third
is the only true rational solution, for it includes, combines,
and reconciles the other two; showing wherein
each is right and wherein wrong. It is the combination
of the two partial truths, and the elimination of the partial
errors. But let us not fail to do perfect justice.
The first two views of origin, whether of the individual
or of the species, are indeed both partly wrong as well as
partly right; but the view of the pious child and of the
Christian contains by far the more essential truth. Of
the two sides of the shield, theirs is at least the whiter
and more beautiful.</p>

<p>But, alas! the great bar to a speedy settlement of
this question and the adoption of a rational philosophy
is not in the head but in the heart&mdash;is not in the reason
but in pride of opinion, self-conceit, dogmatism. The
rarest of all gifts is a truly tolerant, rational spirit. In
all our gettings let us strive to get this, for <i>it</i> alone is
true wisdom. But we must not imagine that all the
dogmatism is on one side, and that the theological.
Many seem to think that theology has a “<i>pre-emptive
right</i>” to dogmatism. If so, then modern materialistic
science has “<i>jumped the claim</i>.” Dogmatism has its
roots deep-bedded in the human heart. It showed itself
first in the domain of theology, because there was the
seat of power. In modern times it has gone over to the
side of science, because here now is the place of power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and fashion. There are <i>two dogmatisms</i>, both equally
opposed to the true rational spirit, viz., the old theological
and the new scientific. The old clings fondly to
old things, only because they are old; the new grasps
eagerly after new things, only because they are new.
True wisdom and true philosophy, on the contrary, tries
all things both old and new, and holds fast only to that
which is good and true. The new dogmatism taunts the
old for credulity and superstition; the old reproaches
the new for levity and skepticism. But true wisdom
perceives that they are both equally credulous and equally
skeptical. The old is credulous of old ideas and
skeptical of new; the new is skeptical of old ideas and
credulous of new. Both deserve the unsparing rebuke
of all right-minded men. The appropriate rebuke for
the old dogmatism has been already put in the mouth
of Job in the form of a bitter sneer: “No doubt ye are
the people, and wisdom shall <i>die</i> with you.” The appropriate
rebuke for the new dogmatism, though not put
into the mouth of any ancient prophet, ought to be uttered&mdash;I
will undertake to utter it here. I would say to
these modern materialists, “No doubt ye are the men,
and wisdom and true philosophy were <i>born</i> with you.”</p>

<p>Let it be observed that we are not here touching the
general question of the personal agency of God in operating
Nature. This we shall take up hereafter. All that
we wish to insist on now is that the process and the law
of evolution does not differ in its relation to materialism
from all other processes and laws of Nature. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
sustentation of the universe by the law of gravitation
does not disturb our belief in God as the sustainer of
the universe, there is no reason why the origin of the
universe by the law of evolution should disturb our
faith in God as the creator of the universe. If the law
of gravitation be regarded as the Divine mode of sustentation,
there is no reason why we should not regard the
law of evolution as the Divine process of creation. It is
evident that if evolution be materialism, then is gravitation
also materialism; then is every law of Nature
and all science materialism. If there be any difference
at all, it consists only in this: that, as already said, here
is the <i>last</i> line of defense of the supporters of supernaturalism
in the realm of Nature. But being the last line
of defense&mdash;the last ditch&mdash;it is evident that a yielding
here implies not a mere shifting of line, but a change
of base; not a readjustment of details only, but a <i>reconstruction
of Christian theology</i>. This, I believe, is indeed
necessary. There can be little doubt in the mind
of the thoughtful observer that we are even now on the
eve of the greatest change in traditional views that has
taken place since the birth of Christianity. But let no
one be greatly disturbed thereby. For as then, so now,
change comes not to destroy but to fulfill all our dearest
hopes and aspirations; as then, so now, the germ of
living truth has, in the course of ages, become so encrusted
with meaningless traditions which stifle its
growth, that it is necessary to break the shell to set it
free; as then, so now, it has become necessary to purge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
religious belief of dross in the form of trivialities and
superstitions. This has ever been and ever will be the
function of science. The essentials of religious faith it
does not, it can not, touch, but it purifies and ennobles
our conceptions of Deity, and thus elevates the whole
plane of religious thought.</p>

<p>It will not, of course, be expected of me to give, even
in briefest outline, a system of reconstructed Christian
thought. Such an attempt would be wholly unbecoming.
Time, very much time, and the co-operation of many
minds, bringing contributions from many departments
of thought, is necessary for this. In a word, it can only
itself come by a gradual process of evolution. But from
the point of view of science some very fundamental
changes in traditional views are already plain. Of these
the most fundamental and important are our ideas concerning
God, Nature, and man in their relations to one
another. These will form the subject of the next three

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF GOD TO NATURE.</span></h2>

<p>We have already said that evolution does not differ
essentially from other laws of Nature in its bearing on
religious belief. It only reiterates and enforces with
additional emphasis what Science, in all its departments,
has been saying all along. The difficulties in the way of
certain traditional views have pressed with ever increasing
force upon the thoughtful mind ever since the birth
of modern science. All along, an issue has been gathering,
but put off from time to time by compromise, until
now, at last, the issue is forced upon us and compromise
is exhausted. The issue (let us look it squarely in the
face) is: Either God is far more closely related with Nature,
and operates it in a more direct way than we have
recently been accustomed to think, or else (mark the alternative)
Nature operates itself and needs no God at
all. There is no middle ground tenable.</p>

<p>Let us trace rapidly the growth of this issue. The
old idea and the most natural to the religious mind was
the direct agency of God in every event and phenomenon
of Nature. This view is nobly expressed in the noblest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
literature in the world&mdash;in the Hebrew and Christian
Scriptures: “He looketh on the earth and it trembleth.
He toucheth the hills and they smoke.” “He maketh
his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
his rain on the just and on the unjust.” But now comes
Science and explains all these phenomena by natural laws
and resident forces, and we all accept her explanation.
Thus, one by one the phenomena of Nature are explained
by the operation of resident forces according to natural
laws, until the whole course of Nature, as we now know
it, has been, or will be, or conceivably may be, thus explained.</p>

<p>Thus has gradually grown up, without our confessing
it, a kind of scientific polytheism&mdash;one great Jehovah,
perhaps, but with many agents or sub-gods, each independent,
efficient, and doing all the real work in his own
domain. The names of these, our gods, are gravity, light,
heat, electricity, magnetism, chemical affinity, etc., and
we are practically saying: “These be your gods, O
Israel, which brought you out of the land of Egyptian
darkness and ignorance. These be the only gods ye
need fear, and serve, and study the ways of.”</p>

<p>What, then, is practically the notion which most
people seem to have of the relation of Deity to Nature?
It is that of a great master-mechanic far away above us
and beyond our reach, who once upon a time, long ago,
and once for all, worked, created matter, endowed it with
necessary properties and powers, constructed at once out
of hand this wonderful cosmos with its numberless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
wheels within wheels, endowed it with forces, put springs
in it, wound it up, set it a-going, and then&mdash;<i>rested</i>.
The thing has continued to go of itself ever since. He
might have not only rested but <i>slept</i>, and the thing
would have gone of itself. He might not only have
slept but <i>died</i>, and still the thing would have continued
to go of itself. But, no, I forget. He must not sleep or
die, for the work is not absolutely perfect. There are
some things too hard even for Him to do in this masterful,
god-like way. There are some things which even He
can not do except in a ’prentice-like, man-like way. The
hand must be introduced from time to time to repair, to
rectify, to improve, especially to introduce new parts,
such as new organic forms.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the compromise until twenty-five
years ago. Nature is sufficient of itself for its <i>course</i>
and continuance, but not for <i>origins</i> of at least <i>some</i> new
parts. Such was the state of the compromise until Darwin
and the theory of evolution. But, now, even this
poor privilege of occasional interference is taken away.
Now, origins, as well as courses, are reduced to resident
forces and natural law. Now, Nature is sufficient of itself,
not only for sustentation, but also for creation.
Thus, Science has seemed to push Him farther and farther
away from us, until now, at last, if this view be
true, evolution finishes the matter by pushing Him entirely
out of the universe and dispensing with Him altogether.
This, of course, is materialism. But this is no
new view now brought forward for the first time by evolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
On the contrary, evolution only finishes what
science has been doing all along.</p>

<p>See, then, how the issue is forced. Either Nature is
sufficient of itself and wants no God at all, or else this
whole idea, the history of which we have been tracing, is
radically false. We have here given by science either a
demonstration of materialism or else a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.
Which is it? I do not hesitate a moment to
say it is a reductio ad absurdum. And I believe that
evolution has conferred an inestimable benefit on philosophy
and on religion by forcing this issue and compelling
us to take a more rational view.</p>

<p>What, then, is the alternative view? It is the utter
rejection with Berkeley and with Swedenborg of the independent
existence of matter and the real efficient
agency of natural forces. It is the frank return to the
old idea of direct divine agency, but in a new, more rational,
less anthropomorphic form. It is the bringing
together and complete reconciliation of the two apparently
antagonistic and mutually excluding views of <i>direct
agency</i> and <i>natural law</i>. Such reconciliation we
have already seen is the true test of a rational philosophy.
It is the belief in a God not far away beyond our reach,
who once long ago enacted laws and created forces which
continue of themselves to run the machine we call Nature,
but a God <i>immanent</i>, a God resident <i>in</i> Nature,
at all times and in all places directing every event and
determining every phenomena&mdash;a God in whom in the
most literal sense not only we but all things have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
being, in whom all things consist, through whom all
things exist, and without whom there would be and could
be nothing. According to this view the phenomena of
Nature are naught else than objectified modes of divine
thought, the forces of Nature naught else than different
forms of one omnipresent divine energy or will, the
laws of Nature naught else than the regular modes of
operation of that divine will, invariable because He is
unchangeable. According to this view the law of gravitation
is naught else than the mode of operation of the
divine energy in sustaining the cosmos&mdash;the divine method
of sustentation; the law of evolution naught else
than the mode of operation of the same divine energy
in originating and developing the cosmos&mdash;the divine
method of creation; and Science is the systematic knowledge
of these divine thoughts and ways&mdash;a rational system
of natural theology. In a word, according to this
view, there is no real efficient force but spirit, and no
real <i>independent</i> existence but God.</p>

<p>But some will object that this is pure <i>Idealism</i>. Yes,
but far different from what usually goes under that
name. The ideal philosophy as usually understood regards
the external world as having no real objective existence
outside of <i>ourselves</i>&mdash;as objectified mental states
of the <i>observer</i>&mdash;as literally such stuff as dreams are made
of&mdash;as a mere phantasmagoria of trooping shadows having
no real existence but in the mind of the dreamer,
and each dreamer makes his own world. Not so in the
idealism above presented. According to <i>this</i> the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
world is the objectified modes, not of the mind of
the observer, but of the mind of God. According to
this, the external world is not a mere unsubstantial figment
or dream, but for <i>us</i> a very substantial objective
reality surrounding us and conditioning us on every
side.</p>

<p>Again, it will be objected that this is pure <i>Pantheism</i>.
Again, we answer “yes.” Call it so if you like, but far
different from what goes under that name, far different
from the pantheism which sublimates the personality of
the Deity into all-pervading unconscious force, and
thereby dissipates all our hopes of personal relation with
him. Properly understood, we believe this view completely
reconciles the two antagonistic and mutually excluding
views of impersonal pantheism and anthropomorphic
personalism, and is therefore more rational than
either. The discussion of this most important point can
only come up after the next chapter, because the argument
for the personality of Deity is derived, not from
without by the study of Nature, but from within in our
own consciousness. We therefore put off its discussion
for the present.</p>

<p>But, finally, some will object, “We can not live and
work effectively under such a theory unless, indeed, we
escape through pantheism.” It may, alas! be true that
this view brings us too near Him in our sense of spiritual
nakedness and shortcoming. It may, indeed, be that we
can not live and work in the continual realized presence
of the Infinite. It may, indeed, be that we must still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
wear the veil of a practical materialism on our hearts and
minds. It may, indeed, be that in our practical life and
scientific work we must still continue to think of natural
forces as efficient agents. But, if so, let us at least remember
that this attitude of mind must be regarded only
as our ordinary work-clothes&mdash;necessary work-clothes it
may be of our outer lower life&mdash;to be put aside when we
return <i>home</i> to our inner higher life, religious and philosophical.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF MAN TO NATURE.</span></h2>

<p>There are two widely distinct views concerning the
relation of man to Nature; the one as old as the history
of human thought, the other only now urged upon us
by modern science. According to the one, man is the
counterpart and equivalent of Nature. He alone has&mdash;in
fact is&mdash;an immortal spirit, and therefore he belongs
to a world of his own. According to the other, man is
but a part, a very insignificant part of Nature, and connected
in the closest way with all other parts, especially
with the animal kingdom. He has no world of his own,
nor even kingdom of his own: he belongs to the animal
kingdom. In that kingdom he has no department of
his own: he is a vertebrate. In the department of vertebrates
he has no privileged class of his own: he is a
mammal. In the class of mammals he has no titled
order of his own: he is a primate, and shares his primacy
with apes. It is doubtful if he may enjoy the privacy
of a family of his own&mdash;the Hominidæ&mdash;for the
structural differences between man and the anthropoid
apes are probably not so great as between the sheep
family and the deer family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Now it is evident that these two are only views from
different points, psychical and structural. From the
psychical point of view it is simply impossible to exaggerate
the wideness of the gap that separates man from
even the highest animals. From this point of view
man must be set over as an equivalent, not only to the
whole animal kingdom, but to the whole of Nature besides.
From the structural point of view, on the contrary,
it is impossible to exaggerate the closeness of the
connection. Man’s body is identified with all Nature in
its chemical constituents, with the body of all animals
in its functions, with all vertebrates, especially mammals,
in its structure. Bone for bone, muscle for muscle,
ganglion for ganglion, almost nerve-fiber for nerve-fiber,
his body corresponds with that of the higher animals.
Whether he was derived from lower animals or not, certain
it is that his structure even in the minutest details
is precisely such as it would be if he were thus derived
by successive slight modifications.</p>

<p>Now, of these two views, the latter has been in recent
times enormously productive in increasing our knowledge.
Anatomy has become truly scientific only through
comparative anatomy; physiology through comparative
physiology; embryology through comparative embryology.
Sociology is fast following in the same line, and
becoming scientific through comparative sociology. Is
not the same true also of psychology? Will not psychology
become truly scientific only through comparative
psychology, i.&nbsp;e., by the study of the spirit of man in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
to what corresponds to it in lower animals? But
this view and this method, when pushed to what seems
to many their logical conclusion, end in identification of
man with mere animals, of spirit with mere physical and
chemical forces, immortality with mere conservation of
energy, and thus leads to blank and universal materialism.
Thus, while it increases our knowledge, it destroys our
hopes. Is there any escape? There is. The two extreme
views given above are not irreconcilable. As already
said, they are only views from different points, and therefore,
although both true, are equally one-sided and partial,
and a true and rational philosophy, in this as in all other
cases of vexed questions, is found only in a higher view,
which combines and reconciles these mutually excluding
extremes. Can we find such a view? I think we can.</p>

<p>Let us first, however, trace some of the stages of this
scientific materialism. There are two main branches
of the argument for materialism: one derived from
<i>brain-physiology</i>, the other from <i>evolution</i>. As we wish
to be perfectly fair, we will present and even press the
argument in both these directions, although the latter
alone bears directly on the subject in hand.</p>

<p>In recent times, physiology has made great and, to
many, startling advances in the direction of connecting
mental phenomena with brain-changes. Physiologists
have established the correlation of vital with chemical
and physical <span class="locked">forces,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> and probably in some sense, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
least, of mental with vital forces. They have proved, in
every act of perception, first a physical change in a nerve-terminal,
then a propagated thrill along a nerve-fiber,
and then a resulting change, physical or chemical, in the
brain; and in every act of volition, a change first in a
brain-cell, then, a return thrill along a nerve-fiber, and a
resulting contraction of a muscle. Even the velocity of
the transmission to and fro has been measured, and
the time necessary to produce brain-changes estimated.
They have also established the existence of physical and
chemical changes in the brain corresponding to every
change of mental state, and with great probability an
exact quantitative relation between these changes of
brain and the corresponding changes of mind. In the
near future they may do more: they may localize all the
different faculties and powers of the mind, each in its
several place in the brain, and thus lay the foundations
of a truly scientific phrenology. In the far-distant future
we may possibly do much more. We may connect
each kind of mental state with a different and distinctive
kind of brain-change. We may find, for example, a
right-handed rotation of atoms associated with <i>love</i>, and
a left-handed rotation associated with <i>hate</i>, or a gentle
sideways oscillation associated with <i>consciousness</i>, and a
vertical pounding associated with <i>will</i>. Now, suppose
all this, and even much more, be done in the way of
associating, both in degree and in kind, mental changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
with brain-changes. What then? “Why,” say the materialists,
“we thereby identify <i>mind</i> with <i>matter</i>, mental
forces with material forces. Thought, emotion, consciousness
and will become products of the brain, in the
same sense as bile is a product of the liver, or urea a
product of the kidneys.”</p>

<p>Such is, in brief, the argument. Now, the answer:
We may do all we have supposed and much more. We
may push our knowledge in this direction as far as the
boldest imagination can reach, and even then we are no
nearer the solution of this mystery of the relation of
brain-changes and mental changes than we are now.
Even then it would be impossible for us to conceive <i>how</i>
brain-changes produce mental changes or <i>vice versa</i>.
Physical changes in sense-organs, transmitted along
nerve-fibers, determine changes in brain-substance. So
much is intelligible. But now there appear&mdash;how it is
impossible to imagine&mdash;consciousness, thought, emotion,
etc.&mdash;phenomena of an entirely different order, belonging
to an entirely different world. So different, that it is
impossible to imagine the nature of the nexus between,
or to construe the one in terms of the other. Brain-cells
are agitated and thought appears: Aladdin’s lamp is
rubbed, and the genie appears. There is just as much
intelligible causal relation between the two sets of phenomena
in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p>Now, this mystery is not of the nature of those which
disappear under the light of knowledge. On the contrary,
science only brings it out in sharper relief, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
emphasizes its absolute unsolvableness. Suppose an absolutely
perfect knowledge, perfect in degree, but human
in kind. Suppose an ideally perfect science&mdash;a science
which has so completely subdued its domain, and reduced
it to such perfect simplicity, that the whole cosmos
may be expressed in a single mathematical formula&mdash;a
formula which, worked out with plus signs, would
give every phenomenon and event which shall ever occur
in the future, and with minus signs every phenomenon
and event which has ever occurred in the past. Surely,
this is an ideally perfect science. Yet, even to such a
science, the relation of brain-changes to mental states
would be as great a mystery as now. It would even
come out in stronger relief, because so many other apparent
mysteries would disappear. Like the essential
nature of matter or the ultimate cause of force, this relation
lies evidently beyond the domain of science. It requires
some other <i>kind</i> of knowledge than human to
understand it.</p>

<p>But materialists insist so much on the identity of
brain-physiology with psychology, that even at the risk
of tediousness we will multiply illustrations in order, if
possible, to make this point still clearer. Suppose, then,
we exposed the brain of a living man in a state of intense
activity. Suppose, further, that our senses were absolutely
perfect, so that we could see every change, of
whatever sort, taking place in the brain-substance.
What would we see? Obviously nothing but molecular
changes, physical and chemical; for to the outside observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
there is absolutely nothing else there to see. But
the subject of this experiment sees nothing of all this.
His experiences are of a different order, viz., consciousness,
thought, emotions, etc. Viewed from the <i>outside</i>, there is&mdash;there
can be&mdash;nothing but motions; viewed from the
<i>inside</i>, nothing but thought, etc.&mdash;from the one side, only
<i>physical</i> phenomena; from the other side, only <i>psychical</i>
phenomena. Is it not plain that, from the very nature of
the case, it must ever be so? Certain vibrations of brain
molecules, certain oxidations with the formation of carbonic
acid, water, and urea on the one side, and there
appear on the other sensations, consciousness, thoughts,
desires, volitions. There are, as it were, two sheets of
blotting-paper pasted together. The one is the brain,
the other the mind. Certain ink-scratches or blotches,
<i>utterly meaningless</i> on the one, soak through and appear
on the other as <i>intelligible writing</i>, but how we know
not, and can never hope to guess. But when the paste
dissolves, <i>shall the writing remain</i>? We shall see.</p>

<p>But some will object. There is nothing specially
strange and unique in all this, for the same mystery underlies
the essential nature of all kinds of force and
matter, and therefore all phenomena. True enough,
but with this difference. Physical and chemical forces
and phenomena are indeed incomprehensible in their essential
nature; but once accept their existence, and all
their different forms are mutually convertible, construable
in terms of each other and all in terms of motion.
But it is impossible by any stretch of the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
to thus construe mental forces and mental phenomena.
It may, indeed, be impossible to conceive <i>how came</i> the
plane of material existence, but, standing on that plane,
all phenomena fall into intelligible order. But there
is another plane above this one, having no intelligible
relation with it. We must climb up and stand on this
before its phenomena fall into intelligible order. In
a word, material forces and phenomena are, indeed, a
mystery, but only of the <i>first order</i>. But mental and
moral forces and phenomena are a mystery even from the
standpoint of the other, and are therefore a mystery of
the <i>second order</i>&mdash;a mystery within a mystery.</p>

<p>We repeat, then, with additional emphasis after this
examination, that we can not imagine between physical
and psychical phenomena a relation of cause and effect
<i>in the same sense</i> in which we use these terms in physical
science, although in some sense there is doubtless
such a relation. If man were the only animal we had
to deal with, there would be no standing ground left for
materialism. But there is still another difficulty which
sticks deeper. It is that suggested by the <i>law of evolution</i>
and enforced by the <i>comparative method</i>.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Man to Animals.</b>&mdash;Man, we say, is endowed
with, <i>is</i>, in fact, an immortal spirit. What is
spirit? We know things only by their phenomena;
what are the phenomena of spirit? Consciousness, will,
intelligence, memory, love, hate, fear, desire&mdash;surely
these are some of them. But has not a dog or a monkey
all these? Pressed with this difficulty, some have indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
felt compelled to accord immortal spirit to higher
animals. But we can not stop here. If to these, then
also to all animals; for we have here only a sliding scale
without break. Can we stop now and make it coextensive
with sentiency? No; for the lowest animals and
lowest plants merge into each other so completely that
no one can draw the line between them with certainty.
We must extend it to plants also. Shall we stop here
and make immortal spirit coextensive with life? We
can not; for life-force is certainly correlated with, transmutable
into, and derivable from, physical and chemical
forces. We must extend it into dead nature also.
Therefore, everything is immortal or none. Our boasted
immortality by continued extension becomes thinner and
thinner until it evaporates into thin air. It becomes
naught else than <i>conservation of energy</i>, and not, as we
had hoped, conservation of <i>self-conscious personality</i>.
This may be interesting as a scientific fact; but of what
value to us personally is a continued existence of our
spiritual forces as heat, light, electricity, or any other
form of unconscious force? Thus, then, if once we pass
the gap between man and the higher animals, there is no
possibility of a stopping-place anywhere.</p>

<p>Such is the difficulty presented by comparison in the
<i>taxonomic</i> series. Take now the <i>embryonic</i> series. Each
one of us, individually, was formed gradually by a process
of evolution, from a microscopic spherule of protoplasm
undistinguishable in structure from the lowest
forms of protozoal life. Now, in this gradual process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
evolution, where did immortal spirit come in? Was
it in the germ-cell? Then why deny it to the protozoan?
Was it at the quickening, or at the birth, or at
the moment of first self-consciousness, or at some later
period of capacity of abstract thought? Again, when
it did come in, was it something superadded or did it
grow out of something already existing in the embryo
or the infant?</p>

<p>Or take the <i>evolution series</i> from protozoan to man.
This we have already seen is similar in outline to the
other two. Now, in the gradual evolution of the animal
kingdom throughout all geological time, terminating in
man, when did immortal spirit come in? Did it enter
with life, or with sentient life, or somewhere in the
ascending scale of animals, or with the advent of man?
If with man, was it some new thing added at once out
of hand, or did it grow out of something already existing
in animals?</p>

<p>This last, we are persuaded, is the only tenable view&mdash;the
only view that can effect that reconciliation between
the two extreme, mutually excluding views now usually
held, which, as already seen, is the true test of a rational
philosophy. I believe that the spirit of man <i>was</i> developed
out of the <i>anima</i> or conscious principle of animals,
and that this, again, was developed out of the lower forms
of life-force, and this in its turn out of the chemical and
physical forces of Nature; and that at a certain stage in
this gradual development, viz., with man, it <i>acquired</i> the
property of immortality precisely as it now, in the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
history of each man at a certain stage, acquires
the capacity of abstract thought. This is, in brief, the
view which I wish to enforce. The reader must understand,
however, that this is <i>my own view</i> only, a view for
which I have earnestly contended for twenty years. It
appeals, therefore, not to authority, but only to reason.
I wish now to present it as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>First, then, I would draw attention to the fact that
there is nothing wholly exceptional in such transformation
with the sudden appearance of new powers and
properties; but, on the contrary, it is in accordance with
many analogies in the lower forces, and therefore <i>a
priori</i> not only credible but probable. For example,
force and matter may be said to exist <i>now</i> on several
distinct planes raised one above another. There is a sort
of taxonomic scale of force and matter. These are, 1,
the plane of elements; 2, the plane of chemical compounds;
3, the plane of vegetal life; 4, the plane of
animal life; and 5, the plane of rational and, as we hope,
immortal life. Each plane has its own appropriate force
and distinctive phenomena. On the first operates physical
forces, producing physical phenomena only&mdash;for
the operation of chemical affinity immediately raises matter
to the next plane. On the second plane operates, in
addition to physical, also chemical forces, producing all
those changes by action and reaction, the study of which
constitutes the science of chemistry. On the third plane,
in addition to the two preceding forces, with their characteristic
phenomena, operates also life-force, producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
the distinctive phenomena characteristic of living
things. On the fourth plane, in addition to all lower
forces and their phenomena, operates also a higher form
of life-force characteristic of animals, producing the phenomena
characteristic of sentient life, such as sensation,
consciousness, and will. On the fifth plane, in addition
to all the preceding forces and phenomena, we have also
the forces and phenomena characteristic of rational and
moral life.</p>

<p>Now, although there are doubtless great differences of
level on each of these planes, yet there is a very distinct
break between each. Although there are various degrees
of the force characteristic of each, yet the difference between
the characteristic forces is one of kind as well as of
degree. Although energy by transmutation may take all
these different forms, and thus does now circulate up and
down through all these planes, yet the passage from one
plane upward to another is not a gradual passage by sliding
scale, but <i>at one bound</i>. When the necessary conditions
are present, a new and higher form of force at once
appears, <i>like a birth</i> into a higher sphere. For example,
when hydrogen and oxygen are brought together under
proper conditions, water is born&mdash;a new thing with new
and wholly unexpected properties and powers, entirely
different from those of its components. When CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O,
and NH<sub>3</sub> are brought together under suitable conditions,
viz., in the green leaves of plants, in the presence of sunlight,
living protoplasm is then and there born, a something
having entirely new and unexpected powers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
properties. It is no gradual process but sudden, like birth
into a higher sphere.</p>

<p>Now, there is not the least doubt that the same is true
of the order and manner of the <i>first appearance</i> of the
natural forces in the phylogenic series. In the history of
the evolution of the cosmos, the forces of Nature have
appeared successively and suddenly when conditions became
favorable. There was a time in the history of the
earth when only physical forces existed, chemical affinity
being held in abeyance by the intensity of the <span class="locked">heat.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> By
gradual cooling, chemical affinity at a certain stage came
into being&mdash;was born, a new form of force, with new and
peculiar phenomena, though doubtless derived from the
preceding. Ages upon ages passed away until the time
was ripe and conditions were favorable, and life appeared&mdash;a
new and higher form of force, producing a still more
peculiar group of phenomena, but still, as I believe, derived
from the preceding. Ages upon ages again passed
away, during which this life-force took on higher and
higher forms&mdash;in the highest foreshadowing and simulating
reason itself&mdash;until finally, when the time was
fully ripe and conditions were exceptionally favorable,
spirit, self-conscious, self-determining, rational, and moral,
appeared&mdash;a new and still higher form of force, but
still, as I am persuaded, derived from the preceding.</p>

<p>Now, that these forces are really of derivative origin is
proved by the fact that we see every step of this process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
taking place daily under our very eyes. I pass over the
conversion of physical into chemical force because this is
admitted on all hands. I begin, therefore, with vital
force. Sunlight falling on green leaves disappears as light
and reappears as life&mdash;is consumed in doing the work of
decomposing CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and NH<sub>3</sub>, and the C, H, O, and
N thus set free from previous combination unite to form
living <span class="locked">protoplasm.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> Again, in the embryonic history of
every animal we see the next change take place&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the
emergence of the psychic out of the vital. In the germ-cell,
in the egg, and even in the early stages of the embryo,
there is no distinctive animal life&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., no consciousness,
nor volition, nor response of any kind to
stimulus. At a certain stage distinctive animal or psychic
life appears. We call it quickening. Materials for
psychology are now present for the first time. In man
alone, and that only some time after physical birth, we
see the last change. The new-born child has animal life
only. The emergence of self-consciousness&mdash;a change so
wonderful that it may well be called the birth of spirit&mdash;takes
place only at the age of two to three years. Now
for the first time we have phenomena distinctive of humanity.</p>

<p>But some will ask, “How is this consistent with immortality?”
In answer, let me again remind the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
that with every new form of force, with every new birth
of the universal energy into a higher plane, there appear
new, unexpected, and, previous to experience, wholly unimaginable
properties and powers. This last birth is of
course no exception. Why may not immortality be one
of these new properties? But this point is so important
that we must treat it more fully.</p>

<p>Remember, then, the view of the relation of God to
Nature, already explained. Remember that the forces of
Nature are naught else than different forms of the one
omnipresent Divine energy. Remember that, as just
shown, this Divine omnipresent energy has taken on successively
higher and higher forms in the course of cosmic
time. Now this upward movement has been wholly by
<i>increasing individuation</i>, not only of matter, but also
<i>of force</i>. This universal Divine energy, in a generalized
condition, <i>unindividuated</i>, diffused, pervading all Nature,
is what we call physical and chemical force. The
same energy in higher form, individuating matter, and
itself individuated, but only yet very imperfectly, is what
we call the <span class="locked">life-force<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> of plants. The same energy, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
fully individuating matter and itself more fully individuated,
but not completely, we call the <i>anima</i> of animals.
This anima, or animal soul, as time went on, was individuated
more and more until it resembled and foreshadowed
the spirit of man. Finally, still the same energy,
completely individuated as a separate entity and therefore
self-conscious, capable of separate existence and therefore
immortal, we call the spirit of man.</p>

<p>According to this view, the vital principle of plants
and the anima of animals are but different stages of the
development of spirit in the womb of Nature: <i>in man at
last it came to birth</i>. In plants and animals it was in
deep embryo sleep&mdash;in the latter, quickened, indeed, but
not viable&mdash;still unconscious of self, incapable of independent
life, with physical, umbilical connection with
Nature; but now at last in man, separated from Nature,
capable of independent life, born into a new and higher
plane of existence. Separated, but not wholly: Nature is
no longer <i>gestative</i> mother, but still <i>nursing</i> mother of
spirit. As the <i>organic embryo</i> at birth reaches independent
<i>material</i> or <i>temporal</i> life, even so <i>spirit embryo</i> by
birth attains independent <i>spiritual</i> or <i>eternal</i> life.</p>

<p>Although birth is its truest correspondence and best
illustration, yet we may vary the illustration in many
ways:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
1. Nature may be likened to a level water-surface.
This represents unindividuated physical and chemical
force. On this surface some individuating force pulls up
a portion of the water into a <i>commencing</i> drop. This
represents the condition of spirit in plants. Or by greater
force the surface may be lifted higher into a nipple-like
eminence <i>simulating a drop</i>, or even into an almost complete
drop with only a neck-like connection with the
general surface. This represents the condition of spirits
in the higher animals. In all these cases, even though
the drop be nearly completed, if we remove the individuating
or lifting force, the commencing drop is immediately
drawn back by cohesion and refunded into the
general watery surface. But, once complete the drop, and
there is no longer any tendency to revert, even though the
lifting force is removed. This represents the condition
of spirit in man.</p>

<p>2. Or Nature may, again, be likened to a water-surface
beneath which the anima of animals is deeply and tranquilly
submerged, wholly unknowing of any higher, freer
world above. In man spirit emerges above the surface
into a higher world, looks down on Nature beneath him,
around on other emerged spirits about him, and upward
to the Father of all spirits above him. Emerged,
but not wholly free&mdash;head above, but not yet foot-loose.</p>

<p>3. Or, again: As a planet must break away from
physical, cohesive connection with the central sun (planet-birth)
in order to enter into higher gravitative relations,
which thenceforward determine all its movements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
beautiful harmony; as the embryo must break away from
physical umbilical connection with the mother in order
to enter into higher spiritual bonds of love, which
thenceforward determine all their mutual relations&mdash;even
so spirit must break away from physical and material
connection with the forces of Nature, which are but the
omnipresent Divine energy, in order thereby to enter
into higher relations of filial love to God and brotherly
love to man.</p>

<p>4. As the new-born child differs little in grade of
physical organization from the mature but unborn embryo,
but at the moment of birth there is a sudden and
complete change, not so much in the grade of organization
but in the whole plane of existence&mdash;a change absolutely
necessary for further advance, for another cycle of
life; even so at the moment of the origin of man, howsoever
this may have been accomplished, there may have
been no great change in the <i>grade</i> of <i>psychical</i> structure,
but yet a complete change in the <i>plane</i> of psychical life&mdash;a
change absolutely necessary for further advance, for
another cycle of evolution. In both cases there is a sudden
entrance into a new world, the sudden appearance of
a new creature with entirely different capacities&mdash;a passing
out of an old world, a waking up in a new and
higher. According to this view, man alone is a <i>child</i> of
God, capable of separate spirit-life&mdash;separate but not yet
wholly independent of Nature. As already said, Nature
is no longer gestative mother, but still nursing mother of
spirit&mdash;we are weaned only by death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
5. Or, again: As in passing up the <i>organic</i> scale, we
find all grades of completeness of organic individuality,
an increasing individuation of bodily form which completes
itself as a perfect organic individual only in the
higher animals, so, also, in passing up the <i>dynamic</i> scale,
force or energy is individuated more and more until
the process reaches completeness as a spirit-individual or
dynamic individual&mdash;a person only in man. <i>Organic</i>
individuality completes itself in animals. <i>Psychic</i> individuality
only in man.</p>

<p>6. One more illustration and the last. The animal
body may be likened to an exquisitely adjusted instrument
of communication between two worlds&mdash;the material
world without and the spiritual world within.
The key-boards of this marvelous instrument are the
nerve-terminals of the sense-organs in contact with the
material world, and the brain-cells in touch with the
spirit-world. External Nature plays on the one by
sensation and determines changes in spirit. Spirit plays
on the other by will and muscular contraction, and determines
changes in external Nature. Now, in animals
spirit is fast asleep or at most dreaming, or even perhaps
somnambulistic, but at least unconscious of <i>self</i>, and acts
only by stimulus&mdash;only responds in some sense automatically
as sleepers do. In man spirit is wide awake and
may respond automatically like animals, or may choose
not to respond at all. Moreover, it acts freely in its own
domain&mdash;the world of ideas&mdash;<i>without external stimulus</i>;
or of its own free-will may <i>initiate</i> changes in the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
world. With God all phenomena commence at
the <i>spirit-end</i>. In animals all commence at the <i>matter-end</i>,
and by automatic response terminate in the same.
Man alone lives in both worlds, partakes of both natures,
and acts according to either method.</p>

<p>The more we reflect on this subject, the more we
shall be convinced that completed spirit individuality
explains, as nothing else can, all that is characteristic
of man. It is this which constitutes person, or the
self-acting ego. It is this which constitutes self-consciousness,
free-will, and moral responsibility. And out
of these, again, grows, the recognition of relations to
other moral beings and to God, and therefore ethics and
religion. Out of these, also, grows the capacity of indefinite
voluntary progress. This also means separate life,
spirit-viability, or immortality. Self-consciousness especially
seems to me the simplest sign of separate entity or
spirit-individuality, and its appearance among psychical
phenomena <i>the very act of spirit-birth</i>. We may imagine
man to have emerged ever so gradually from
animals: in this gradual development the moment he
became conscious of self, the moment he turned his
thoughts inward in wonder upon himself and on the
mystery of his existence as separate from Nature, that
moment marks the birth of humanity out of animality.
All else characteristic of man followed as a necessary
consequence. I am quite sure that, if any animal, say a
dog or a monkey, could be educated up to the point of
self-consciousness (which, however, I am sure is impossible),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
that moment <i>he</i> (no longer <i>it</i>) would become a
moral responsible being, and all else characteristic of
moral beings would follow. At that moment would
come personality, immortality, capacity of voluntary
progress; and science, philosophy, religion, would quickly
follow.</p>

<p>We have emphasized self-consciousness as the most
fundamental sign of spirit-individuality; but a difference
of exactly the same kind is found running through the
whole gamut of human faculties as compared with corresponding
faculties in animals. As animal consciousness
is related to human self-consciousness, so exactly is animal
will to human free-will, animal intelligence to human
reason, animal sign-language to rational grammatical
speech of man, constructive art of animals to true rational
progressive art of man. In every one of these the
resemblance is great, but the difference is immense, and
not only in degree but also in kind. In every case it is
like shadow and substance, promise and fulfillment, or,
still better, it is like embryo and child. The change
from one to the other is like to a birth into a higher
sphere, the beginning of another cycle of evolution. We
would like to follow this idea out in detail, but it would
lead us beyond the scope of this work. Those who desire
to do so we would refer to an article by the author on the
“Psychical Relation of Man to <span class="locked">Animals.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>But it will be objected that there are other births<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
of energy from lower to higher condition; but such
births do not insure continued existence in the higher
condition. In the gradual evolution of energy described
on <a href="#Page_316">page&nbsp;316</a>, when a portion rises from physical to
chemical, from chemical to vital, or from vital to sentient,
it does not remain ever after in the higher condition&mdash;there
is no immortality on the higher plane.
On the contrary, all these lower forms of energy are
continually ascending and descending; transformation
is downward as well as upward. Why should there be
an exception in this last birth? In these successive
upward metamorphoses of energy why should the last
only be permanent? I answer: Because it reaches at
last its final goal, viz., complete individuation, as free,
self-acting spirit; it reaches again the spiritual plane
from which it sprang, and becomes thereby a partaker
of the Divine nature; because it comes at last into moral
relations with the absolute&mdash;the Divine&mdash;and therefore
above the plane of shifting changes. If the scale of
energy be likened to a ladder with many rounds, reaching
from the plane of matter to the plane of spirit, then so
long as energy is on the ladder it ascends and descends;
but, once it reaches the plane of free spirit, it is in a
wholly new world in which eternal ascent is the law.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can best bring out the reasonableness of
my view by comparing it with other possible alternative
views.</p>

<p>There are three possible views as to the nature, the
origin, and the destiny of the human spirit: (1.) That it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
pre-existed always&mdash;uncreated, underived, eternal, both
ways&mdash;backward as well as forward. Therefore, as it
never began, so it will never end. It is <i>immortal of its
own right</i>. This is substantially the view of Plato, of
Leibnitz, and perhaps some other philosophers. (2.)
That it is derived from God <i>directly</i>&mdash;created at once
<i>without natural process</i>; that at the moment of creation
of the first man Adam, and at some unknown time and
in some inscrutable way in the history of each individual,
it was <i>injected into the body from the outside</i>, and
at the same time <i>endowed</i> with immortality. This, I
take it, is the orthodox view. (3.) That it was indeed
derived from God, but not directly; created indeed, but
only by natural process of evolution; that it indeed pre-existed,
but only as embryo in the womb of Nature,
slowly developing through all geological times, and finally
coming to birth as <i>living</i> soul in man. Thus it <i>attains</i>
immortality at a certain stage of development, viz., at
spirit-birth. This is the view I have striven to enforce.</p>

<p>I hold up these three views: Which is the more
rational? The view of Plato&mdash;that of self-existent, uncreated,
eternal spirit&mdash;I think few will entertain at this
time of the world’s day. The usual orthodox view I
have shown is surrounded with insuperable difficulties;
is wholly unscientific and irrational. What is there left
but the view presented above? Plato is right in asserting
pre-existence, but wrong in denying creation. The usual
view is right in asserting creation, but wrong in denying
natural process. The view I have presented asserts pre-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>existence
in embryo and creation by natural process. It
therefore combines and reconciles the two extreme views,
and is more rational than either.</p>

<p><b>Some General Conclusions.</b>&mdash;There are still two or
three thoughts so closely connected with what we have
already said that we can not pass them over:</p>

<p>1. We have seen that every mental state corresponds
with a particular brain state, and every mental change
with a brain change. We have, therefore, here, two
series, physical and psychical, corresponding with each
other, term for term. For every change in the one there
is a corresponding change in the other, both in kind and
amount. Now, is not this the test of the relation of
cause and effect? It certainly is. Yes, there must be
a causal relation here, even though we are not able to
understand the nature of the causal nexus. But which
is cause and which effect? If the view above presented
be correct, then in animals <i>brain changes</i> are in all cases
the <i>cause</i> of psychical phenomena. In man alone, and
only in his higher activities, <i>psychic</i> changes precede
and determines brain changes. In man alone brain
changes are determined not only by external but by
<i>internal</i> impressions. Man alone perceives not only objects&mdash;<i>material
things</i>&mdash;but also relations and properties
<i>abstracted</i> from the objects, i.&nbsp;e., <i>ideal things</i>; and,
moreover, not only relations between objects, but also
relations between relations or ideas. In man alone
there is an inner world&mdash;microcosm&mdash;the <i>things</i> of
which are <i>thoughts</i>, ideas, etc. This <i>self-acting power</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of spirit on <i>the things of itself</i>, instead of merely reacting
as played upon by external nature, is characteristic
of man, and is a necessary result and a sign
of severance, partial at least, of physical bond with
Nature.</p>

<p>2. Again, I have used the term vital <i>principle</i>. I
must justify it. I know full well that it is the fashion
to ridicule the term as a remnant of an old superstition
which regards vital force as a sort of supernatural entity
unrelated to other forces of Nature. No one has striven
more earnestly than myself to establish the correlation of
vital with physical and chemical <span class="locked">forces;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> and yet, if the
view above presented be true, there is a <i>kind</i> of justification
even for the term vital <i>principle</i>&mdash;much more, vital
<i>force</i>. There is a kind of reason and true insight in the
personification of the forces of Nature, and especially of
vital force. All forces, by progressive dynamic individuation,
are on the way toward entity or personality, but
fully attain that condition only in man.</p>

<p>3. Again, to perceive relations and properties abstracted
from material things, to form abstract or general
ideas, to form not only <i>per</i>cepts but also <i>con</i>cepts, is admitted
to be a characteristic of man&mdash;a characteristic on
which all our science and philosophy rest. From time
immemorial the vexed question has been debated, “Have
such abstract or general ideas any <i>real</i> existence, or are
they mere <i>names</i> of figments of the mind?” This is
the famous question of <i>realism</i> and <i>nominalism</i>. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
if our view be correct, then there is one most fundamental
abstraction, viz., <i>self</i>, which is indeed a <i>reality</i>.
Self-consciousness is the direct recognition of the one
reality, spirit, of which all others are the sign and
shadow&mdash;the true reality which underlies and gives potency
to all abstractions or ideas. Do we not find in this
view, then, the foundation of a true realism, or rather a
complete reconciliation of realism and nominalism?</p>

<p>4. Thus, then, Nature, through the whole geological
history of the earth, was gestative mother of spirit,
which, after its long embryonic development, came to
birth and independent life and immortality in man. Is
there any conceivable meaning in Nature without this
consummation? All evolution has its beginning, its
course, its end. Without spirit-immortality this beautiful
cosmos, which has been developing into increasing
beauty for so many millions of years, when its evolution
has run its course and all is over, would be precisely as if
it had never been&mdash;an idle dream, an idiot tale signifying
nothing. I repeat: Without spirit-immortality the cosmos
has no meaning. Now mark: It is equally evident
that, <i>without this gestative method of creation of spirit</i>,
the whole geological history of the earth previous to man
would have no meaning. If man’s spirit were made at
once out of hand, why all this elaborate preparation by
evolution of the organic kingdom? The whole evolution
of the cosmos through infinite time is a gestative process
for the birth of spirit&mdash;a divine method of the creation of
spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Thus, again, man is born of Nature into a higher nature.
He therefore alone is possessed of two natures&mdash;a
lower, in common with animals, and a higher, peculiar
to himself. The whole mission and life-work of man is
the progressive and finally the complete dominance, both
in the individual and in the race, of the higher over the
lower. The whole meaning of sin is the humiliating
bondage of the higher to the lower. As the <i>material</i>
evolution of Nature found its goal, its completion, and
its significance in man, so must man enter immediately
upon a higher <i>spiritual</i> evolution to find its goal and
completion and its significance in the ideal man&mdash;the
Divine man. As spirit, unconscious in the womb of Nature,
continued to develop by <i>necessary</i> law until it came
to birth and independent life in man, so the new-born
spirit of man, both in the individual and in the race,
must ever strive by <i>freer</i> law to attain, through a newer
birth, unto a higher life.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III_V" id="CHAPTER_III_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF GOD TO MAN.</span></h2>

<p>In the two preceding chapters we have discussed the
relation of God to Nature and of man to Nature. There
is still another relation, if possible, of still more vital importance
to us, viz., the <i>relation of God to man</i>. This,
of course, introduces the question of revelation&mdash;a subject
which I approach with some reluctance. I feel I am
treading on holy ground, and must do so with shoes removed.
If it be asked, How is evolution concerned
with the subject of revelation? I answer Evolution
emphasizes and enforces the reign of law taught by all
science, and makes it at last <i>universal</i>. Many conclude,
therefore, that, if evolution be true, a belief in the possibility
of any form of revelation is irrational. I do not
think this follows, and I will give my reasons. I do so,
however, very briefly, because we are not yet ready to
formulate our views except in the most general way.</p>

<p>If man be indeed something more than a higher species
of animal; if man’s spirit be indeed a spark of Divine
energy individuated to the point of self-consciousness
and recognition of his relation to God; if spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
embryo, developing in the womb of Nature through all
geological time, came to birth and independent spirit-life
in man, and thus man alone is a <i>child of God</i> as well as a
product of Nature&mdash;if all this be true, then it is evident
that this wholly <i>new</i> relation requires also a wholly different
mode of Divine operation. If God operates on
Nature only by regular processes, which we call <i>natural
laws</i>, then he <i>must</i> operate on spirit in a different and
a more direct way, and this we call <i>revelation</i>. If to the
student of Nature it is inconceivable that He should
operate on Nature except by natural laws (for this
is the name we give to His chosen mode of operation
there), then to the student of theology it is equally inconceivable,
if our view of man be true, that He should not
operate on spirit in some more direct and higher way,
i.&nbsp;e., by revelation.</p>

<p>But some will ask, Is not this a palpable violation of
law? I think not. All divine operations are, must be,
according to reason, i.&nbsp;e., according to law. The operation
of the divine on the human spirit, i.&nbsp;e., revelation,
must therefore be according to law, but a higher law
than that which governs Nature, and, therefore, from <i>the
point of view of Nature</i>, supernatural. There is nothing
wholly unique in this. Life is a higher form of force
than the physical and chemical. Life-phenomena are
therefore super-physical, and if we confined the term
Nature to dead Nature they would be supernatural. So
the free, self-determined acts of spirit on spirit, even of
the spirit of man on the spirit of man, much more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Spirit of God on the spirit of man, may be according
to law, and yet from the natural point of view be supernatural.
It is true that, in the complex of phenomena,
material and spiritual inextricably woven together,
which go to make up human life, Science must ever
strive to reduce as much as possible to material laws, for
this is her domain, and she is bound to extend it; but, if
our view of man be true, there will always remain a
large residuum of phenomena&mdash;a whole world of phenomena&mdash;which
will never yield, because clearly beyond
her domain. Standing on the lower material plane, these
phenomena are wholly super-material, and therefore incomprehensible
from the material point of view. We
must rise and stand on the higher plane before these also
are reduced to law, but a higher law than that operating
on the lower plane. If, therefore, science insists on banishing
the supernatural from the realm of Nature, theology
may reasonably insist on its necessity, <i>in this sense</i>,
in the realm of morals and religion.</p>

<p>If, then, the direct influence of the Spirit of God
on the spirit of man be what we call revelation, then
there is evidently no other kind of revelation possible;
and, furthermore, such revelation is given to all men in
different degrees. It is given to all men as conscience;
in greater measure to all great and good men as clearer
perception of righteousness; in pre-eminent measure to
Hebrew prophets and Christian apostles; but supremely
and perfectly to Jesus alone. But there is, and in the
nature of things there can be, <i>no test of truth but reason</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
We <i>must</i> fearlessly, but honestly and reverently,
try all things, even revelations, by this test. We must
not regard, as so many do, the spirit of man as the passive
amanuensis of the Spirit of God. Revelations to man
must of necessity partake of the imperfections of the
medium through which it comes. As pure water from
heaven, falling upon and filtering through earth, must
gather impurities in its course differing in amount and
kind according to the earth, even so the pure divine
truth, filtering through man’s mind, must take imperfections
characteristic of the man and of the age. Such filtrate
must be redistilled in the alembic of reason to
separate the divine truth from the earthy impurities.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III_VI" id="CHAPTER_III_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE OBJECTION, THAT THE ABOVE VIEW IMPLIES PANTHEISM,
ANSWERED.</span></h2>

<p>It will be observed that the views presented in the
last three chapters are closely connected with one another,
and all conditioned on the “Relation of God to Nature,”
urged in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_III">Chapter III</a>. Now it will doubtless be objected
to this view, especially as applied in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_IV">Chapter IV</a> on the
“Relation of Man to Nature,” that it is naught else than
pure pantheism; that it destroys completely the personality
of Deity, and with it all our hopes of communion
with him, and all our aspirations of love and worship
toward him; that, according to this view, God becomes
only the soul or animating principle of Nature, operating
everywhere but unconsciously like the vital principle
of an organism; that the whole cosmos becomes in fact a
great organism, developing under the operation of <i>resident</i>
force according to <i>necessary</i> law, only that <i>we</i>
apotheosize this omnipresent force and call it God; and
finally, that God is naught else than an abstraction,
created like other abstractions or general ideas wholly by
the human mind, and having no objective existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Furthermore, it will be said, that according to this view,
this omnipresent unconscious energy individuates itself
by necessary law of evolution more and more until it
reaches, <i>for the first time in man</i>, self-consciousness and
immortality, and thus that man himself is the only self-conscious
immortal being in existence, and therefore the
only being worthy of reverence and worship. Thus, this
view leads to humanity-worship or rather to <i>self-worship</i>.</p>

<p>I feel the full force of this objection. I answer it as
follows: I freely admit that, following up this scientific
line of thought alone, we are carried strongly in the direction
of pantheism. But there is nothing strange or exceptional
in this. In all the deepest questions, single
lines of thought inevitably carry us to extreme one-sided
views. This seems to be the necessary result of the
essentially two-fold nature of man, self-conscious spirit
in a material body, the relation between which is, and
must ever be, inscrutable. On this account there is and
must be a fundamental antithesis in human philosophy,
i.&nbsp;e., two lines of thought, the material and spiritual, which
lead to two apparently irreconcilable <span class="locked">views.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> We have
already seen that a rational philosophy, whenever we are
able to reach such, is always found in a higher and more
comprehensive view, which includes, combines, and reconciles
two one-sided, partial, and mutually excluding
views. But spirit and matter, or mind and brain, or God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
and Nature, is <i>the</i> fundamental antithesis which underlies
and is the cause of all other lesser antitheses. This antithesis,
therefore, is absolutely fundamental, and therefore
forever irreconcilable. We must accept both sides, even
though we can not clearly perceive the nature of their
relation. We must be content with compromise where
we can not effect complete reconciliation. We must
frankly acknowledge that the antagonism is apparent
only, and the result of the limitation of our faculties,
and believe that, if we could only rise to a high enough
point of view, like all other antitheses, this also would
disappear in a rational philosophy.</p>

<p>Now, to apply these principles. No one, we admit,
can form a clear conception of how immanence of Deity
is consistent with personality, and yet we must accept
both, because we are irresistibly led to each of these by
different lines of thought. Science, following one line of
thought, uncorrected by a wider philosophy, is naturally
led toward the one extreme of pantheistic immanence; the
devout worshiper, following the wants of his religious nature,
is naturally led toward the other extreme of anthropomorphic
personality. The only rational view is to
accept both immanence and personality, even though we
can not clearly reconcile them, i.&nbsp;e., immanence without
pantheism, and personality without anthropomorphism.
We have already seen in the third chapter, how following
the scientific line of thought, we are logically driven
to immanence. We wish now to show how, following another
line of thought, we are as logically driven to personality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
On this most difficult subject, however, all we
are prepared to do is to throw out some brief suggestions,
in the hope that they may be carried out more perfectly by
some thoughtful reader; scatter some seed-thoughts, in
the hope that, falling haply on good soil, they may spring
up and bear more fruit than I have been able to produce.</p>

<p>1. In the gradual individuation of the universal Divine
energy described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_IV">Chapter IV</a>, there must of course
be a corresponding growth of a kind of independent self-activity
which reaches completeness in man, and in fact
constitutes what we call self-consciousness and free will.
The exact nature of the relation of Deity or of the general
forces of Nature to this gradually individuated portion,
I do not undertake to define. And how this idea of
partial self-activity comports with the absoluteness of
Deity we can not clearly understand. But this fact need
not specially disturb us here; for this is only one branch
of the wider question of the moral agency of man in relation
to the absolute sovereignty of God, or the freedom
of man in relation to necessary law in Nature.</p>

<p>2. <b>Personality behind Nature.</b>&mdash;We have already shown
that, if the brain of a living, thinking man were exposed
to the scrutiny of an outside observer with absolutely perfect
senses, all that he would or could possibly see would be
molecular motions, physical and chemical. But the subject
himself, the thinking, self-conscious spirit, would experience
and observe by introspection only consciousness,
thought, emotion, etc. On the <i>outside</i>, only physical phenomena;
on the <i>inside</i> only psychical phenomena. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
<i>must not the same be necessarily true of Nature also?</i>
Viewed from the outside by the scientific observer, nothing
is seen, nothing can be seen, there is nothing else to
be seen, but motions, material phenomena; but behind
these, on the other side, on the <i>inside</i>, must not there
be in this case also psychical phenomena, consciousness,
thought, will; in a word, <i>personality</i>?<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> In the
only place where we do get behind physical phenomena,
viz., in the brain, we find psychical phenomena. Are
we not justified, then, in concluding that in all cases
the psychical lies behind the physical? The human
brain is a wonderful instrument, by means of which, in
some inscrutable way, viz., in our own experience, we do
get behind, on the other side, on the inside of some material
phenomena, and in so far become partakers of the
Divine nature. But behind other phenomena of Nature
we may never hope to penetrate either by observation or
experience, but only in dim way by highest reason. Science,
even in the case of the brain, can not pass from the
one kind of phenomena to the other. If she would study
the <i>inside</i> she must abandon the <i>outside</i>&mdash;she must abandon
the microscope and take to introspection. If she
would study the phenomena of the higher platform, she
must leave the lower and climb up and stand on the
higher. If this be true of the brain where the two kinds
of phenomena are brought so close together, how much
more is it true of the phenomena of the cosmos. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
can never hope, either by observation or by experience, to
pass beyond the veil. We must abandon the methods of
science and reach it, if at all, in some other way. Not the
clear-sighted but the pure-hearted shall see God in Nature.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we see that our own self-conscious personality
behind brain phenomena compels us to accept consciousness,
will, thought, personality behind Nature. Now
I assert that, once get this abstract idea in the mind,
and by a necessary law of thought it gradually expands
without limit, and eventually reaches the form of infinite
consciousness, will, thought, etc., and therefore of an infinite
person. This law of indefinite expansion may be
illustrated by the ideas of space and time. The animal,
and, indeed, the infant, understands space and time only
in their relation to itself, but has not yet abstracted these
from their contents. This comes only with the birth of
self-conscious personality. But, so soon as the abstract
idea of space is acquired, by a necessary law of mental
activity it expands without limit, and finally becomes
the idea of infinite space. Similarly, so soon as the idea
of time as abstracted from its contents is conceived, it
inevitably expands without limit and grows into the
idea of infinite time. So is it precisely with the idea of
self-conscious personality. The animal or the very young
child is indeed conscious of its body and of external
objects in their mutual relations, but not of self, as abstracted
from its contents. The animal never attains it,
the child does. Now, so soon as this idea of self-conscious
personality&mdash;of a spiritual entity underlying material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
phenomena&mdash;appears, by a necessary law of mental
activity it expands without limit, and inevitably reaches
the idea of an infinite self, an infinite person, God, behind
the phenomena of Nature.</p>

<p>But some will object that this idea of infinite personality
is inconceivable. True enough; but <i>the opposite is
far more inconceivable</i>. The ideas of infinite space and
infinite time are also inconceivable, yet we must accept
them, because the idea of all space or all time being limited
is still more inconceivable; for if we think of space
or time as limited, immediately there comes the question,
“What is there beyond the limit?” There is
therefore this wide difference between these two inconceivables:
the one is so only in the sense of transcending
the power of our mind, but the other is unthinkable,
self-contradictory, absurd. So also is it with
self-conscious personality. The idea of an infinite self,
i.&nbsp;e., God, is indeed inconceivable, but only in the sense of
transcending our power of comprehension; but the idea
of the consciousness behind the cosmos as being limited or
finite is more than inconceivable, it is unthinkable, self-contradictory,
absurd; for immediately comes the question,
“What is there beyond which limits it?” To the
Greek mind Zeus was limited; therefore of necessity came
also the idea of Fate, superior to and limiting Zeus himself.
To them, therefore, Fate was the real God&mdash;the absolute.</p>

<p>3. <i>Divine Personality.</i>&mdash;I have used the word personality
as expressing the nature of God. But let me not be
misunderstood. I well know we can not conceive clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
of an infinite, unconditioned personality. Deeply considered,
it seems nothing short of a contradiction in terms.
All I insist on is this: In our view of the nature of God,
the choice is not between personality and something
<i>lower</i> than personality, viz., an <i>unconscious force</i> operating
Nature by <i>necessity</i>, as the materialists and pantheists
would have us believe; but between personality as we
know it in ourselves and something inconceivably <i>higher</i>
than personality. Language is so poor that we are
obliged to represent even <i>our</i> mental phenomena by physical
images. How much more, then, the Divine nature
by its human image! Self-conscious personality is the
highest thing we know or can conceive. We offer him
the very best and truest we have when we call him a
Person; even though we know that this, our best, falls
far short of the infinite reality.</p>

<p>4. <b>Cause in Nature.</b>&mdash;We have thus far spoken only or
principally of self-consciousness, but the same precisely is
true of another essential attribute of personality, viz., <i>free-will</i>.
Every one admits causative force or forces operating
in Nature. Science has shown that all the different
kinds of force are but different forms of one omnipresent
energy. Now, looking abroad on Nature from the outside,
this omnipresent energy seems to modern science as
simply resident, inherent in matter itself, and therefore
as operating unconsciously and by necessity. But the
question occurs, “Whence did we get the idea of force,
energy, <i>causation</i>?” I answer unhesitatingly: We get
it not from without by observation of Nature, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
within through consciousness; not from the outside view,
but from, the inside view of phenomena. We can not
conceive of phenomena without force, of effects without
cause, because we are intensely conscious of being ourselves
through our wills an active cause of external phenomena.
If we were merely passive observers, not active
causers of changes in the external world, then these
external phenomena would seem to us merely to shift
and change and succeed each in a certain order. We
might note the order and determine the laws of sequence,
and thus form a science; but it would never
enter into our minds to imagine any causal or dynamical
nexus between them. In the mind of such passive observer,
but not doer&mdash;thinker, but not worker&mdash;would
be completely realized the only thorough-going and consistent
materialistic philosophy, i.&nbsp;e., a philosophy in
which, like Comte’s, cause and force have no place&mdash;are
in fact banished as a superstition from science. But
the clear consciousness of essential energy, of causative
force within, the certainty that we ourselves, through
our wills and by the conscious exertion of force do determine
changes in the external world, compels us to
attribute all changes to causative force of some kind,
and naturally enough, until the interference of science,
to a personal will like our own. Thus by a necessary
law we project our internal states into external Nature.</p>

<p>But see now the steps of evolution of this idea. At
first, i.&nbsp;e., in the uncultured races, and also in childhood,
external forces take the form of a personal will like our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
own residing in <i>each object</i>, and controlling its phenomena
as our wills control our bodily movements (fetichism).
Then, as culture advances, it takes next the form
of several personal wills controlling each the phenomena
of a different department of Nature (polytheism).
Finally, in the highest stage of culture, it takes the
form of one personal will controlling the phenomena of
the whole cosmos (monotheism). To the religious but
unscientific mind in all these stages the personal will is
anthropomorphic. But we have already seen (<a href="#CHAPTER_III_III">Chapter
III</a>) how anthropomorphism has been driven by science
from one department after another, until now at last
by evolution it is driven out of Nature entirely, and
to those following this line of thought alone, the phenomena
of Nature are relegated to forces inherent in
matter, and operating by laws necessary and fatal; and
not only so, but material forces are made to invade
even the realm of consciousness, and reduce this also to
material laws. Thus the savage <i>e</i>jects his own conscious
personal will into every separate object of Nature; the
modern materialist <i>in</i>jects material forces into the realm
of consciousness. But, as already seen, a rational philosophy
admits these two antithetic views, and strives to
combine and reconcile them. This reconciliation, as far
as it is possible for us, is found in a personal will immanent
in Nature, and determining directly all its
phenomena.</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that the idea of a causal nexus
between successive phenomena is a primary conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
and therefore ineradicable and certain. Even from the
purest evolution point of view it must be true, for, if
man’s mind grew out of the forces of Nature, this idea
must represent a fact in Nature. Also, analysis shows
that all causative force originates in <i>will</i>. Lastly, culture
and reason, by a necessary law of expansion, carry
us upward to the conception of one infinite sustaining
and creative will. Science may sometimes obscure
but can not destroy this idea. Evolution, which
was supposed by some to have destroyed it for ever, has
only temporarily obscured it in the minds of the unreflecting,
by the supposed identity of evolution with
materialism. From this temporary eclipse it now
emerges with still greater clearness and far greater nobleness.
For, observe: All the effects known to us in
Nature are finite; therefore a personal will, which determines
these <i>separately</i> by successive acts, as we do, must
also be finite like ourselves. But a will, which by <i>one
eternal</i> act ever-doing, never done, determines the evolution
and the sustentation of an infinite cosmos, must itself
be infinite. Thus only in the doctrine of universal
evolution do we rise to a just conception of God as an infinite
cause.</p>

<p>5. <b>Design in Nature.</b>&mdash;As the idea of <i>cause</i> and force
is related to <i>will</i>, so precisely is the idea of <i>design</i> related
to <i>thought</i>. We get this also, not from without, but from
within. Adaptation of means to ends is in our experience
the result of thought, and we can not conceive it to
result otherwise. The effect of science can not be to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
this primary conception&mdash;which, indeed, like all primary
conceptions, is ineradicable, and already more certain
than anything can be made by proof&mdash;but only to exalt and
purify our conceptions of the designer. For, observe: In
any case of <i>adaptive</i> structure, whether in the animal body
or in planetary relations, the evidence of design is not in
the materials, but in the <i>use</i> of the materials; not in the
<i>parts</i>, but in the <i>adjustment</i> of the parts for a purpose.
Design, purpose, adjustment, <i>adaptation</i>, are not material
things, but relations or intellectual things, and
therefore perceivable only by thought, and conceivable
only as the result of thought. It is simply impossible
to talk about such adaptive structures without using language
which implies design. The very word “<i>adaptive</i>”
implies it. It is impossible even to think of such structures
without implicitly assuming intelligence as the
cause. It makes no particle of difference <i>how</i> the material
originated, or whether it ever originated at all; it
matters not whether the adaptation was done at once out
of hand, or whether by slow process of modification; it
matters not whether the adaptive modification was
brought about by a process of natural selection, or by
pressure of a physical environment; whether without law
or according to law. The removal of the result from man-like
directness of separate action can not destroy the idea
of design, but only modify our conception of the Designer.
What science, and especially evolution, destroys, therefore,
is not the idea of design, but only our low anthropomorphic
notions of the mode of working of the Designer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Precisely the same change takes place here under the
influence of science as has taken place in all our notions
concerning God. The uncultured savage sees a <i>separate</i>
god in every object. As culture advances, his gods become
fewer and nobler, until, in the most advanced
states, man recognizes but one infinite God, the creator
and sustainer of all. God is still in every phenomenon,
but no longer as a separate God, but only as the separate
manifestation of the One. Thus culture takes away
our gods, but only to compel us to seek him in nobler
forms until we reach the only true God. But, even after
the conception of the one God is reached, how many
seem to regard him as altogether such a one as ourselves;
but science shows us that his ways are not like
our ways, nor his ends as our ends. Thus science,
more than all other kinds of culture, simplifies while it
infinitely ennobles and purifies our conceptions of Deity.</p>

<p>Again, the same change takes place in our sense of
<i>mystery</i>. I suppose most people imagine that it is the
special mission of science to destroy all mystery. Many
seem to think that superstition, or even religion, is inseparably
connected with ignorance and mystery, and all
must disappear together before the light of science.
But not so. There is only a gradual progressive change&mdash;an
evolution in the form of mystery as well as in the
form of religion. To the savage everything is a <i>separate</i>
mystery. The function of science is, indeed, to
destroy these separate mysteries, by explaining them;
but, in doing so, it only reduces them to fewer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
grander mysteries, and these again to still fewer and
grander, until, in an ideally perfect science, all separate
and partial mysteries are swallowed up in the one all-embracing
infinite mystery&mdash;the mystery of existence.
There is still mystery in each object, but no longer a
separate mystery&mdash;only a separate manifestation of the
one overwhelming mystery.</p>

<p>Or, again, and finally: The same change occurs in
our ideas of <i>creation</i>. At first every object is a separate
creation&mdash;a manufacture. With advancing science these
separate, creative acts become fewer and nobler, until
now, at last, in evolution, all are embraced and swallowed
up in <i>one eternal</i> act of creation&mdash;a never-ceasing procession
of the divine energy. Every object is still a
creation, but not a separate creation&mdash;only a separate
manifestation of the one continuous creative act.</p>

<p>Now, precisely the same change must take place in
our conception of design in Nature. To the uncultured
there is a distinct and separate design in every separate
work of Nature. But, as science advances, all these
distinct, separate, petty, man-like designs are merged
into fewer and grander designs, until, finally, in evolution
at last, we reach the conception of the one infinite,
all-embracing design, stretching across infinite space, and
continuing unchanged through infinite time, which includes
and predetermines and absorbs every possible
separate design. There is still design in everything, but
no longer a separate design&mdash;only a separate manifestation
of the one infinite design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Thus, then, our own self-consciousness and will and
thought give rise, necessarily, to the conception of an
infinite self-consciousness, will, and thought&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., God.
The necessity to believe in self-conscious spirit behind
bodily phenomena compels us to believe also in an infinite
self-conscious spirit behind cosmic phenomena.
Looking at the operations of this ever-active spirit, whether
in the one case or the other, <i>from the outside</i>, it looks
like unconscious energy inherent in matter itself, and
therefore like necessity, or fate. But, looked at from the
inside <i>in the one case</i>, the brain, we perceive only self-conscious,
free activity of spirit. Therefore, we are compelled
to acknowledge in the other case, the cosmos, also,
the same source of all activity, the same cause of all phenomena.
We are compelled to acknowledge an infinite
immanent Deity behind phenomena, but manifested to us
on the outside as an all-pervasive energy. But some portion
of this all-pervasive energy again individuates itself
more and more, and therefore acquires more and more a
kind of independent self-activity which reaches its completeness
in man as self-consciousness and free-will. We
said, “<i>a kind of</i> independent self-activity.” How this
comports with the absoluteness of God we can not understand,
any more than we can understand how it comports
with invariable law in Nature. We simply accept them
both as primary truths, even though we can never hope to
reconcile them completely, because we can not understand
the exact nature of the relation of spirit to matter. We
can not look at the outside and the inside at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
time. If we could understand the relation of psychical
phenomena to brain-changes, then might we hope to
understand far more perfectly than now the relation of
God to Nature. But as in the one case, the brain, although
we can not understand the <i>nature</i> of the relation,
yet we are sure of the intimacy of the connection of the
two series, psychical and physical, term for term; so in
the other case, the cosmos, although we can not understand
the exact <i>nature</i>, we are sure of the intimacy of the
connection, <i>term for term</i>&mdash;every material phenomenon
and event with a corresponding psychical phenomenon as
its cause.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III_VII" id="CHAPTER_III_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="subhead">SOME LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOCTRINE OF
THE DIVINE IMMANENCY.</span></h2>

<p>The doctrine of the Divine immanency carries with
it the solution of many vexed questions. In fact, in its
light these questions simply pass out of view as no longer
having any significance. Several of these questions have
been alluded to in an indirect way in the previous chapter
and in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_III">Chapter III</a>. We take them up distinctly here,
and show their relation to evolution.</p>

<p>Religious thought, like all else, is subject to a law of
evolution, and therefore passes through regular stages.
Of these stages, three are very distinct and even strongly
contrasted. They correspond in a general way to the
three stages of Comte, which he has misnamed the <i>theological</i>,
the <i>metaphysical</i>, and the <i>positive</i>. We will illustrate
by many examples.</p>

<h3>I. <i>Conception of God.</i></h3>

<p>This, the most fundamental conception of all religion,
has passed from a gross anthropomorphism to a true
spiritual theism, and the change is largely due to science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
and especially to the theory of evolution. There are
three main stages in the history of this change: (1.) The
first is a <i>low</i> anthropomorphism. God is altogether such
a one as ourselves, but larger and stronger. His action
on Nature, like our own, is <i>direct</i>; his will is wholly
man-like, capricious and without law. (2.) The second is
still anthropomorphism, but of a nobler sort. God is not
<i>altogether</i> like ourselves. He is man-like; yes, but also
<i>king-like</i>. He is <i>not</i> present in Nature, but sits enthroned
above Nature in solitary majesty. He acts on Nature, not
directly but indirectly, through physical forces and natural
laws. He is an absentee landlord governing his estate
by means of appointed agents, which are the natural
forces and laws established in the beginning. He interferes
personally and by direct action only occasionally, to
initiate something new or to rectify something going
wrong. This idea culminated and found the clearest expression
in the eighteenth century, and was the necessary
result of the scientific ideas then prevalent, viz., ideas of
pre-established <i>stability</i> of cosmic order and <i>fixedness</i> of
organic types. God was the great <i>artificer</i>, the great
<i>architect</i>, working, as it were, on foreign material and
conditioned by its nature. He established all things as
they are in the beginning, and they have continued so
ever since.</p>

<p>This conception still lingers in the religious mind, and
is in fact the prevailing one now. It is a great advance on
the preceding, but, alas! it removes God beyond the reach
of our love. He is the architect of worlds, the artificer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
of the eye, the sovereign ruler of the universe, but not
our Father. We are his creatures, his subjects, but not his
children.</p>

<p>(3.) The third and last stage in this development is
true spiritual theism. God is immanent, resident in Nature.
Nature is the house of many mansions in which
he ever dwells. The forces of Nature are different forms
of his energy acting directly at all times and in all places.
The laws of Nature are the modes of operation of the
omnipresent Divine energy, invariable because he is perfect.
The objects of Nature are objectified, externalized&mdash;materialized
states of Divine consciousness, or Divine
thoughts objectified by the Divine will. In this view we
return again to <i>direct</i> action, but in a nobler, a spiritual,
Godlike form. He is again brought very near to every
one of us and restored to our love, for in him we live
and move and have our being. In him all things consist,
by him all things exist. This view has been held by noble
men in all times, especially by the early Greek fathers,
but is now verified and well-nigh demonstrated by the
theory of evolution. No other view is any longer tenable.</p>

<p>The idea of God is of course the most fundamental of
all religious ideas, and a change in this carries with it
many other changes. Some of these necessary outcomes,
especially the nature, the origin, and the destiny of the
human spirit, and its relation to the Divine spirit, I have
already treated in previous chapters. But there are others
which flow so directly and obviously that they may be
presented in brief space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<h3>II. <i>Question of First and Second Causes.</i></h3>

<p>Among the most obvious of these is the question of
first and second causes. This distinction, I suppose, did
not exist in early thought. As a popular view, it was
mainly due to the physical science of the eighteenth century.
It was a necessary corollary of the idea of God as
the great architect sitting outside of Nature and acting on
Nature as on foreign material. According to this view,
God is the original and primary cause of all things; but he
<i>delegates</i> his power to <i>secondary</i> forces, such as gravity,
heat, electricity, etc., which are therefore the immediate
causes of phenomena. I believe that most persons hold
this view still. But it is now being displaced by the idea
of God immanent or resident in Nature as already explained.
This view is a complete <i>identification</i> of first
and second causes. All causes are mere modes of the
first cause. They seem to us secondary, necessary, and
unconscious only because they act according to invariable
law. But law itself is only the mode of operation of a
perfect will. Thus we have the same three stages of evolution
here also: (1.) First, all is first cause, direct, man-like,
capricious, lawless. (2.) Then the first cause acts
king-like, indirectly by many appointed agents subject
to pre-enacted laws. These agents or secondary causes
directly determine all natural phenomena. (3.) Lastly,
come the complete combination and reconciliation of
these two. All is by first cause and direct action, like the
first. All is by invariable law like the second, the law
being only the mode of operation of a perfect will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<h3>III. <i>Question of General and Special Providence.</i></h3>

<p>So also providence, general and special, is only another
phase of the same question and solved in the same
way. At first all is <i>special</i> providence&mdash;the result of caprice
or favoritism and without law. Then all or nearly
all is general providence operating by invariable law; but
from time to time the general law is broken through for
special purposes when necessary. Is not this the prevailing
view now? Lastly, these two must be combined and
reconciled in a third. All is alike general and special:
general&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., according to law; special&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., by direct
action. There is no real distinction between the two.
The distinction vanishes in the light of a higher view.</p>

<h3>IV. <i>The Natural and the Supernatural.</i></h3>

<p>In precisely the same category falls the question of the
natural and the supernatural. The same three stages are
evident here also, and the same solution: 1. First all is
supernatural and lawless, and Nature is viewed with
stupid wonder and abject fear. 2. Then Nature is reduced
to mechanical laws and made subject to man.
Wonder and fear give place to indifference and even perhaps
to contempt. We practically live without God in
the world. It requires, now, <i>miracles</i> or a violent breaking
through of law in order to startle us out of our stupidity
and awaken in us a sense of the Divine presence.
3. But we must come lastly to a higher philosophy. We
must recognize that all is natural and all is supernatural
according as we view it, but none more than another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
All is natural&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., according to law; but all is supernatural&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
above Nature, as we usually regard Nature,
for all is permeated with the immediate Divine presence.
Wonder in the contemplation of Nature returns, or rather
exalted reverence and rational worship are given in place
of open-mouthed wonder and superstitious fear. Once
clearly conceive the idea of God permeating Nature and
determining directly all its phenomena according to law,
and the distinction between the natural and the supernatural
disappears from view, and with it disappears also
the necessity of miracles as <i>we usually understand miracles</i>.
In fact, the word as we usually understand it has
no longer any meaning.</p>

<p>I must stop a moment to explain, lest I be misunderstood;
and to enforce, lest it be thought I speak lightly.</p>

<p>Miracle, in the sense of violation of law, is simply impossible,
because law is the expression of the essential
nature and perfection of God. It is as impossible for
God to perform a miracle in this sense as it is for him to
lie, and for the same reason, viz., that it is contrary to
his essential nature. In what sense, then, is a miracle
possible? I answer, only as an occurrence or a phenomenon
<i>according to a law higher than any we yet know</i>.
If we define Nature as phenomena governed by physical
and chemical laws and forces, then life becomes supernatural
and miraculous&mdash;because higher than Nature as
we define it. If we reduce the phenomena of life to law
and include these also in our definition of Nature but
limit it there, then the free, self-determined phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
of reason become supernatural because above our definition
of Nature. There may well be still other and higher
modes of Divine activity, the law of which we do not and
may never understand. These are above our present definition
of Nature, and therefore to us supernatural or
miraculous. But, even if miracles in the ordinary sense
were possible, is it not evident that the ordinary processes
of Nature are far more wonderful, more truly Godlike,
than any such miracle?</p>

<h3>V. <i>Question of Design in Nature.</i></h3>

<p>So, again, the question of design or purpose or mind
in Nature is similarly solved. It has been said, it is continually
now being said, that evolution has destroyed forever
the teleological view of Nature&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the idea of
design in Nature. Yes, if we mean the man-like, cabinet-making,
watch-making design of Paley and older writers&mdash;a
separate petty design for each separate object. It has
indeed destroyed this, but only to replace it by a far
nobler conception&mdash;a truly Godlike design, a design embracing
all space and running through all time, including
and absorbing all possible separate designs and predetermining
them by a universal law of evolution.</p>

<p>Or the same question may be put in another way as
“Mind <i>vs.</i> Mechanics in Nature.” In the evolution of
thought on this subject at first all was <i>mind</i>, but lawless,
capricious, like our own. Then one department after
another of Nature was reduced to mechanical, physical,
necessary law, until all have been or will be or conceivably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
may be thus reduced, and mind seems driven out of
Nature entirely. The friends of religion in despair cry
out for at least some small corner left for mind. Thus I
find in recent numbers of an English scientific periodical,
“Nature,” a discussion concerning mind as <i>one</i> of the
factors of <span class="locked">evolution.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> Is it not amusing, if it were not so
sad?&mdash;God the Divine mind as <i>one of the factors</i> of evolution!
The true solution is very simple. All is mind or
none; so also all is mechanics or none. It <i>is all mind
through mechanics</i>. It is all mechanics from the outside;
it is all mind from the inside. To science all is
mechanics; to theology all is mind. It is the duty of
philosophy to reconcile these two opposites by the higher
view that mechanics is but the mode of operation of the
Divine mind. There is only one form of evolution, viz.,
human progress, in which mind&mdash;but the <i>human</i>, not the
Divine mind&mdash;is <i>one</i> of the factors of evolution. But to
think and speak thus of God in relation to Nature is to
place him on the human plane. It is gross <span class="locked">anthropomorphism.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span></p>

<h3>VI. <i>Question of the Mode of Creation.</i></h3>

<p>I might multiply examples almost without limit, of
questions the solution of which depends on this one of the
relation of God to Nature. I give one more&mdash;Creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
The creation of the universe <i>at once</i>&mdash;in the beginning&mdash;out
of nothing&mdash;and then <i>rest ever since</i>. This
old anthropomorphic idea is now replaced by that of continuous
creation&mdash;unhasting, unresting, by an eternal
process of evolution. For if the universal law of gravitation
is the Divine mode of sustentation of the universe,
the no less universal law of evolution is the Divine process
of creation.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF EVOLUTION TO THE IDEA OF THE
CHRIST.</span></h2>

<p>What think ye of Christ? This is indeed in
many ways a test-question, and we ought frankly to
meet it. I have feared heretofore to touch this question.
I now only throw out some brief suggestions&mdash;scatter
some seed-thoughts. Does Evolution have anything
to say on this also? I think it does. This I proceed
to show:</p>

<p>As organic evolution reached its goal and completion
in <i>man</i>, so human evolution must reach its goal and
completion in the <i>ideal man</i>&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., the Christ. According
to this view, the Christ is the ideal man, and therefore&mdash;(mark
the necessary implication)&mdash;and therefore the
Divine man. We are all as men (as contradistinguished
from brutes)&mdash;we are <i>all</i>, I say, <i>sons of God</i>; the Christ
is the well-beloved Son. We are <i>all</i> in the image of God;
he is the express and <i>perfect image</i>. We are all partakers
in various degrees of the Divine nature; in him
the Divine nature is completely realized. It is not necessary
that the ideal man&mdash;the Christ&mdash;should be perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
in knowledge or in power; on the contrary, he must
grow in wisdom and in stature, like other men; but he
must be <i>perfect in character</i>. <i>Character is essential
spirit.</i> All else, even knowledge, is only environment for
its culture. In the dazzling light of modern science we
are apt to forget this. Character is the <i>attitude</i> of the
human spirit toward the Divine Spirit. If I should add
anything to this definition, I would say it is spiritual
<i>attitude</i> and spiritual <i>energy</i>. In the Christ this attitude
must be wholly right; the harmony&mdash;the union with the
Divine&mdash;must be perfect. This perfect union gives, of
necessity, also fullness of spiritual energy.</p>

<p>Now, I wish to show that, although the Christ as thus
defined must be human&mdash;yes, even more intensely human
than any one of us&mdash;yet by the law of evolution we
ought to expect him to differ from us in an inconceivable
degree, and especially in a superhuman way. This I do
by a series of illustrations.</p>

<p>We have said that the Christ is the ideal and therefore
the Divine man&mdash;that he is the goal and completion of
humanity. But in evolution a goal is not only a completion
of one stage, but also the beginning of another
and higher stage&mdash;on a higher plane of life with new and
higher capacities and powers <i>unimaginable from any
lower plane</i>. Let me illustrate:</p>

<p>1. As man is the ideal&mdash;the goal and completion of
animal evolution, and yet is he also a birth into a higher
plane of life&mdash;the spiritual; so the Christ, the ideal man,
may be only the goal and completion of human evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
and yet is he also a birth into a new and higher plane&mdash;<i>the
Divine</i>.</p>

<p>2. As the human spirit pre-existed in embryo in animals,
slowly developing through all geological times,
until it came to birth and immortality in man, so the
Divine spirit is in embryo in man in various degrees of
development, and comes to birth and completion of
Divine life in the Christ.</p>

<p>3. As animals reached, finally, <i>conscious relations</i> with
God in man, even so man reaches <i>union</i> with God in the
Christ. As man, the ideal animal, is a union of the
<i>animal</i> with the <i>spiritual</i>; so the Christ, the ideal of
human evolution, is a union of the <i>human</i> and the
<i>Divine</i>.</p>

<p>4. Finally: As with the appearance of man there
were introduced new powers and properties unimaginable
from the animal point of view, and therefore from
that point of view seemingly supernatural&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., above
their nature&mdash;so with the appearance of the Christ we
ought to expect new powers and properties unimaginable
from the human point of view, and therefore to us seemingly
supernatural&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., <i>above our nature</i>.</p>

<p>The Christ as defined above&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., as the <i>ideal man</i>&mdash;is
undoubtedly a true object of rational worship. There
are two and only two fundamental moral principles, viz.,
love to God and love to man. Both of these must be embodied
in a rational worship. The one must be embodied
in the worship of an Infinite Spirit&mdash;God; the other in
the worship of the ideal man&mdash;the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
But some one will object that, admitting all this, it is
impossible that the goal, the ideal, should appear until the
<i>end of the course</i> of evolution. To him I answer: This
is indeed true of animal evolution, but not of human evolution.
We have already seen (see <a href="#Page_88">p.&nbsp;88 <i>et seq.</i></a>) that there
is an essential difference in this regard between these two
kinds of evolution. In addition to all the factors of organic
evolution, in human progress there is a new and
higher factor added, which immediately takes precedence
of all others. This factor is <i>the conscious voluntary co-operation
of the human spirit in the work of its own evolution</i>.
The method of this new factor consists essentially
in the formation, and especially in the <i>voluntary
pursuit, of ideals</i>. In organic evolution <i>species</i> are transformed
by the <i>environment</i>. In human evolution <i>character</i>
is transformed by <i>its own ideal</i>. Organic evolution
is by <i>necessary</i> law&mdash;human evolution is by voluntary
effort, i.&nbsp;e., by <i>free</i> law. Organic evolution is <i>pushed</i> onward
and upward from behind and below. Human evolution
is <i>drawn</i> upward and forward from above and in
front by the attractive force of ideals. Thus the ideal of
organic evolution can not appear until the end; while the
attractive ideals of human evolution <i>must</i> come&mdash;whether
only in the imagination or realized in the flesh&mdash;but must
come somehow <i>in the course</i>. The most powerfully attractive
ideal ever presented to the human mind, and,
therefore, the most potent agent in the evolution of human
character, is <i>the Christ</i>. This ideal must come&mdash;whether
in the imagination or in the flesh I say not, but&mdash;must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
come somehow <i>in the course</i> and not at the end. At the
end the whole human race, drawn upward by this ideal,
must reach the fullness of the stature of the Christ.</p>

<p>But it will be again objected that all ideals are relative
and temporary; that we are in fact drawn onward and upward
by many successive ideals, one beyond another, in
the course. Ideals are but mile-stones which we put successively
behind us while we press on to another; they
are successive rounds of an infinite ladder which we put
successively beneath us while we rise higher. This one
also we shall eventually put behind us and pass on.</p>

<p>To this I have two answers: Admitted that in many
ways such is the course of progress; but who has been
able to reach this ideal and conceive a higher? When this
one is reached and completely realized in our personal
character, it will be time enough to propose another.</p>

<p>Again, it is true that in many ways we have advanced
and are still advancing by the use of partial ideals; but
this use of partial and relative ideals is itself in only a
temporary stage of evolution. At a certain stage we catch
glimpses of the <i>absolute</i> moral ideal. Then our gaze becomes
fixed, and we are thenceforward drawn upward forever.
The human race has already reached a point when
the absolute ideal of character is attractive. This Divine
ideal can never again be lost to humanity.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF EVOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF EVIL.</span></h2>

<p>The problem of evil has tasked the power and baffled
the skill of the greatest thinkers in every age. It would
be folly in me to imagine that I can solve it. Its complete
solution is probably impossible in the present state
of science. Yet I can not doubt that on this, as on every
important question relating to man, the theory of evolution
will throw new and important light. All I can hope
to do is to throw out some brief suggestions on the subject.</p>

<p>If evolution be true, and especially if man be indeed
a product of evolution, then what we call evil is not a
unique phenomenon confined to man, and the result of
an accident, but must be a great fact pervading all nature,
and a part of its very constitution. It must have
existed in all time in different forms, and subject like
all else to the law of evolution. Let us, then, trace rapidly
some of the steps of this evolution.</p>

<p>1. <i>External Physical Evil in the Animal Kingdom.</i>&mdash;As
already seen in previous chapters, the necessary
condition of evolution of the organic kingdom is a <i>struggle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
for life&mdash;a conflict on every side, with a seemingly
<i>inimical</i> environment and a survival of only the strongest,
the swiftest, or the most cunning&mdash;in a word, the
fittest. Now, suppose the course of organic evolution
finished in the introduction of man, and from this vantage-ground
we look back over the course and consider
its result. Shall we call that evil which was the necessary
condition of the progressive elevation which culminated
so gloriously? Evil doubtless it seemed to the
individual, struggling animal, but is this worthy to be
weighed in comparison with the evolution of the whole
organic kingdom until it culminated in man? Is it not
rather a <i>good</i> in disguise? I suppose human arrogance
may be willing enough to admit it in <i>this</i> case, where
animals only are sufferers.</p>

<p>2. <i>Physical Evil in Relation to Man.</i>&mdash;But organic
evolution, completed in man, was immediately transferred
to a higher plane, and continued as social evolution;
material evolution is transformed into psychical
evolution; unconscious evolution, according to <i>necessary</i>
law, to conscious voluntary progress toward a recognized
goal, and according to a <i>freer</i> law. But in this
transformation the fundamental conditions of evolution
do not change. Man also is surrounded on every side
with what at first seems to him an <i>evil environment</i>,
against which he must ever struggle or perish. Heat
and cold, tempest and flood, volcanoes and earthquakes,
savage beasts and still more savage men. What is the
remedy&mdash;the only conceivable remedy? Knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
the laws of Nature, and thereby acquisition of power
over Nature. But increasing knowledge and power are
equivalent to progressive elevation in the scale of psychical
being. This conflict with what seems an evil environment
is, therefore, the necessary condition of such
elevation. It is not too much to say that, without this
condition, except for this necessity for struggle, man
could never have emerged out of animality into humanity,
or, having thus emerged, would never have risen
above the lowest possible stage. Now suppose, again,
this ideal to have been attained&mdash;suppose knowledge of
physical laws and power over physical forces to be complete&mdash;suppose
physical nature completely subdued, put
beneath our feet, and subject to our will, and, from the
high intellectual position thus attained, we look back
over the whole ground and consider the result. Shall
that be called evil which was obviously the necessary
condition for attaining our then elevated position?
Evil it doubtless seemed to the individuals who fell,
and still seems to us who now suffer, by the way in
the conflict; but is physical discomfort or even physical
death of the individual to be weighed in comparison
with the psychical elevation of the individual, and especially
of the race? Evidently, then, physical evil even
in the case of man is only <i>seeming</i> evil, but <i>real</i> good.</p>

<p>3. <i>Organic Evil&mdash;Disease.</i>&mdash;But there is a more
dreadful form of evil than that which results from <i>external</i>
physical nature&mdash;an evil far more subtle and difficult
to understand, and therefore to conquer. I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
<i>internal</i> organic evil&mdash;disease in its diversified forms and
with its attendant weakness and suffering, inscrutable
often in its causes, insidious in its approaches, contagious,
infectious, spreading from house to house, carrying
suffering and death in its course, and leaving sorrow
and desolation behind. Is there any remedy which can
transmute this evil into good? There is. It is again
knowledge&mdash;knowledge of the laws, and power over the
forces, of <i>organic nature</i>. Is it not evident that complete
knowledge of the laws of health and the causes of disease
would put this evil also under our feet? Is it not
evident that a perfect knowledge of the laws of health,
and a perfect living according to these laws, would so
entirely subdue this evil that men would no longer die
except by natural decay or by accident? Is it not evident,
also, that the race will not attain this knowledge
unless it be forced upon us by the necessity of avoiding
the dread evil of disease?</p>

<p>Now suppose, again, this ideal attained, suppose this
dread evil subdued by complete knowledge, and again
from our elevated intellectual position we look back over
the ground. Shall we call that evil which was the necessary
condition of our intellectual elevation? Evil,
doubtless, it seems to us individuals who have suffered
and are still suffering through our ignorance; but is
such individual suffering or even individual death to
be weighed against the psychical elevation of the individual
and evolution of the race? Ought not the
individual to be willing to suffer thus much vicariously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
for the race? Is not this seeming evil also a <i>real</i>
good?</p>

<p>May we not, then, confidently generalize? May we
not say that all physical evil is good in its general effect&mdash;that
every law of Nature is beneficent in its general
operation, and, if sometimes evil in its specific operation,
is so only through our ignorance? Partly by survival of
the fittest, and partly by intelligence, man, like other
animals, brings himself in accord with the laws of Nature,
and thus appropriates the good and avoids the evil,
and Nature becomes beneficent only. But, also unlike
any other animal, man by rational knowledge makes the
laws of Nature his servants, and uses them for his own
purposes, thus increasing his power and elevating the
plane of his life.</p>

<p>4. <i>Moral Evil.</i>&mdash;But there is still another form of
evil, the most dreadful of all. This one may be called
<i>the</i> evil, in some sense, <i>the only evil</i>. It is that of which
all other forms are but the shadows cast backward and
downward along the course of evolution and on lower
stages of existence. This consummation of all evil is
<i>sin</i>&mdash;<i>moral disease</i>&mdash;more dreadfully contagious and
deadly than any organic disease. What shall we say
now? Is there any rational explanation of this evil?
Is there any possible-reason or excuse for an all-wise, all-powerful
Ruler afflicting man alone of all His creatures
with this greatest of all evils? In all other cases, the
individual and the race sacrifice themselves for a time
<i>physically</i> for the sake of final spiritual elevation; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
this <i>is spiritual debasement</i>. In all other cases, there is a
sacrifice in the <i>course</i> in order to attain the <i>goal</i>, but this
is a missing of the goal itself. Is there any view which
mitigates this evil, any philosophic alchemy which can
transmute this evil into good? Age after age the human
mind has prostrated itself in helpless paralysis before
this problem. Most thinkers have been content to say,
“Thou hast ordered it so. Thou art good. It must be
right.” But many, and among them some of the best
minds, have said, “Either God is not all-good, or else
not all-wise, or else not all-powerful, or else there is no
God at all.” Does evolution shed any light on this
dread problem? I believe it does.</p>

<p>We have said that all other evils are but shadows of
this one, cast backward and downward on earlier stages
of evolution and lower forms of existence. But from
the evolution point of view these earlier and lower forms
of evil are rather to be regarded as <i>fore</i>shadowings of the
reality to come. They are but earlier and lower stages
of the evolution of the <i>same thing</i>&mdash;embryonic conditions
of the now full-grown evil. If so, then the same
law must apply here also, though, as we shall see, with
a difference. Here, also, the individual as well as the
race finds himself surrounded by what seems an evil environment,
against which he must struggle. The spirit
of man is inclosed and conditioned by a lower environment,
which he must subdue or perish. Here, then, is
again a deadly conflict: “a law in the members warring
against the law of the spirit, and bringing it into captivity”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
a law of selfism warring against the law of love, and
bringing it into subjection; solicitations to debasement
on the one hand, and solicitations to wrong others on the
other. How shall it be overcome? What is the remedy?
Again I answer, Knowledge of and conformity to
the <i>laws of the moral world</i>. But, as in other cases, so
in this: this knowledge of and conformity to law, which
is the true goal of humanity, will not be attained unless
it is forced upon us by necessity and in self-defense&mdash;i.&nbsp;e.,
by evil.</p>

<p>Now suppose, once more, this knowledge and conformity
be complete, and the ideal of humanity be attained,
and from this final and highest position we look
back over the whole ground. Shall that be called evil
which from the very nature of a moral being and the
laws of evolution was obviously the necessary condition
of attaining the goal? Shall we not from this final position
call it a good in disguise? Evil, doubtless, it seems
to us who suffer and stumble and mayhap fall by the
way; but shall the mishap of the individual be weighed
as an equivalent against the evolution of the race and the
attainment of its goal?</p>

<p>Ah! there is the rub. It is all well enough to talk
of sacrificing the <i>physical</i> individual to the race, but
not so the <i>spiritual</i>. If we believe in the immortality of
the human spirit, if we do indeed stand related to God
in the manner explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_III_IV">Chapter IV</a>, then moral
evil in the individual has an entirely peculiar and an
eternal significance&mdash;then the individual human spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
has an infinite worth and can not be sacrificed to the
race; for the evolution of the race itself is only in order
to the perfecting of individual human souls. What
shall we say now? I answer: The sacrifice is not necessary.
There is in the realm of morals <i>alone</i> a way of
escape&mdash;a saving element which redeems the individual
without violating the law. Let me explain.</p>

<p>It will, I think, be admitted by all that <i>innocence</i>
and <i>virtue</i> are two very different things. Innocence is
a <i>pre-established</i>, virtue a <i>self-established</i>, harmony of
spiritual activities. The course of human development,
whether individual or racial, is from innocence through
more or less discord and conflict to virtue. And virtue
completed, regarded as a condition, is holiness, as an
activity, is spiritual freedom. Not happiness nor innocence
but virtue is the goal of humanity. Happiness
will surely come in the train of virtue, but if we seek
primarily happiness we miss both. Two things must be
borne steadily in mind: virtue is the <i>goal of humanity</i>;
virtue can not be given, it must be <i>self-acquired</i>.</p>

<p>Now we have already seen that in all evil the remedy,
which not only cures it but transmutes it into good, is
knowledge of law and conformity of conduct thereto&mdash;a
true science and a successful art&mdash;in a word, knowledge
of the laws of God and obedience to these laws. In the
physical world ignorance of these laws is necessarily fatal,
but not so in the moral world. Ignorance here is not
necessarily fatal though dangerous. By the very nature
of a moral being, the essential thing is not knowledge but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
<i>character</i> or virtue&mdash;the <i>will</i> to know and the <i>effort</i> to
obey. In the physical realm, knowledge is the goal; in
the moral realm, knowledge is only in order to virtue.
Therefore, in the case of the individual struggling with
moral evil within and without, the victory is always in
his power. If he fails, it is his own fault. His utmost effort
in this field must be successful, because the result is
not external, but internal and in the realm of moral
freedom. The spirit of man is self-acting and in some
sense, though not absolutely, self-existing, and can not be
ruined except by its own act. In the moral world, where
the goal is not knowledge but character, attainment must
be in proportion to honest endeavor in the right spirit.</p>

<p>Evil, then, has its roots in the necessary law of evolution.
It is a necessary condition of all progress, and
pre-eminently so of moral progress. But some will ask,
“Why could not man have been made a perfectly pure,
innocent, happy being, unplagued by evil and incapable
of sin?” I answer: The thing is impossible even to
omnipotence, because it is a contradiction in terms.
Such a being would also be incapable of virtue, would
not be a moral being at all, would not in fact be man.
We can not even conceive of a moral being without freedom
to choose. We can not even conceive of virtue
without successful conflict with solicitations to debasement.
But these solicitations are so strong and so
often overcome us, that we are prone to regard the solicitations
themselves as essential evil instead of our weak
surrender to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
All evolution, all progress, is from lower to higher
plane. From a philosophic point of view, things are not
good and evil, but only higher and lower. All things are
good in their true places, each under each, and all must
work together for the good of the ideal man. Each
lower forms the basis and underlying condition of the
higher; each higher must subordinate the lower to its
own higher uses, or else it fails of its true end. The
physical world forms the basis and condition of the organic,
yet the organism rises to a higher plane only by
ceaseless conflict with and adaptation to the physical environment,
which therefore seems in some sense evil.
The organic world in its turn underlies and conditions
and <i>nourishes</i> the rational moral world. As the senses
are the necessary feeders of the intellect, so the appetites
are the necessary feeders of the moral nature.
Yes, even the lowest sensual appetites are the necessary
basis and nourishers of our highest moral sentiments.
And yet the struggle for mastery of the higher spiritual
with the lower animal is often so severe that the latter
seems to many as <i>essential evil</i> to be extirpated, instead
of a useful <i>servant</i> to be controlled. This view is asceticism.
Now the whole view of evil usually held is a kind
of asceticism, and therefore, like asceticism, must be only
a transition phase of human thought. All that we call
evil both in the material and the spiritual world is good,
so long as we hold it in subjection as servants to the spirit,
and only becomes evil when we succumb. All evil consists
in the dominance of the lower over the higher; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
good in the rational use of the lower by the higher.
Asceticism may, indeed, be the best philosophy for some.
If we can not subdue the lower nature, we must try to
extirpate it, and thus at any cost set free the higher from
humiliating bondage. If we can not practice the higher
virtue of <i>temperance</i> in <i>all</i> things, we must even try the
lower virtue of <i>total abstinence</i> in <i>some</i> things. If our
right eye offends, we must not hesitate to pluck it out;
but let us not imagine that one eye is better than two&mdash;let
us clearly understand that thereby our spiritual
nature is sadly maimed, and therefore that the highest
virtue, which is spiritual beauty and strength, can not
thus be attained. True virtue consists, not in the extirpation
of the lower, but in its subjection to the
higher. The stronger the lower is, the better, <i>if only</i>
it be held in subjection. For the higher is nourished
and strengthened by its connection with the more robust
lower, and the lower is purified, refined, and glorified
by its connection with the diviner higher, and by this
mutual action the whole plane of being is elevated. It
is only by action and reaction of all parts of our complex
nature that true virtue is attained.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>  Mr. Wallace has recently, in his work on “Darwinism,” taken
strong ground against this Darwinian factor. He thinks, for example,
that sexual vigor is the cause of both the splendor of color and the
pertinacity which secures the female. We see little difference in this
way of putting it. Our object, however, is not to argue the question
of what are true factors, but simply to give the most accepted, and,
as it seems to us, also the most probable view.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>  By <i>reason</i> I mean the faculty of dealing with the phenomena of
the <i>inner world of consciousness and ideas</i>. Animals live in one world&mdash;the
outer world of <i>sense</i>; man in two&mdash;the outer world of sense,
like animals, but also in an inner and higher world of <i>ideas</i>. All that
is characteristic of man comes of this capacity of dealing with the
inner world. In default of a better word I call it reason. If any one
can suggest a better word, I will gladly adopt it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>  While all comparative anatomists agree that the lung is a diverticulum
from the œsophagus, like the air-bladder of the gar-fish, some
think that it is a <i>different</i> diverticulum, which is seen first in the dipnoi.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>  Undoubtedly the true principle on which primary groups ought to
be made is, <i>identity of general plan of structure</i>, or <i>traceableness of homology
throughout</i>. For these groups are the great primary branches of
the tree of life, and classification ought to represent degrees of genetic
relationship. This was Agassiz’s principle, although he did not admit the
genetic relation. This principle has been, it seems to us, too much neglected
by later systematists.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>  The Amphioxus, the lowest of all vertebrates&mdash;if vertebrate it may
be called&mdash;is an exception to 2 and 3. In this animal the vertebrate
type is not yet fully declared.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>  This is only one example under a general law which it may be
well to stop a moment to illustrate. A repetition of similar parts performing
the same function is always an evidence of low organization,
and as we rise in the scale of organization such parts usually become
fewer and more efficient. Thus, to give one example, myriapods, as their
name indicates, have hundreds of locomotive organs&mdash;lower crustaceans
perhaps thirty or forty. As we go up, they are reduced to fourteen (tetradecapods),
then to ten (decapods), then in spiders to eight, in insects
to six, in vertebrates to four, and in man to two. A similar reduction in
number, but increase in efficiency, is found in toes, <i>when they are used for
support and locomotion only</i>. In man we find the normal number of five
(1), because his hands are used for grasping and the functions of the
fingers are not the same; and (2), because man’s development was almost
wholly <i>brainward</i>. In other respects his structure is far less specialized
than most other mammals. He can not compete with carnivores in
strength and ferocity, nor with herbivores in fleetness. In the struggle
for life, therefore, there was nothing left for him but increase in intelligence.
Probably four is the smallest number of locomotive organs consistent
with highest efficiency. In retaining but two legs for locomotion,
man has lost in locomotive efficiency, but by the sacrifice he liberates two
limbs for higher functions.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>  The origin of vital from chemical force in the green leaves of

mystery of the <i>first origin of life on the earth</i>, for one condition of the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>  I know it is the fashion to ridicule the use of the terms vitality,
vital force, as a remnant of an old superstition; and yet the same men
who do so use the terms gravity, electricity, chemical force, etc. Vital
force is indeed <i>correlated</i> with other forces of Nature, but is none the
less a distinct <i>form</i> of force, far more distinct than any other unless it
be the still higher form of psychical, and therefore it better deserves a
distinct name than any lower form. Each form of force gives rise to a
peculiar group of phenomena, and the study of these to a special department
of science. Now, the group of phenomena called vital is more
peculiar, more different from other groups than these are from each
other, and the science of physiology is a more distinct department than
either physics or chemistry, and therefore the form of force, which determines
these phenomena, is more distinct and better entitled to a name
than any physical or chemical force.</p></div>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Illustrations were printed mid-paragraph but have been moved between
paragraphs, usually near to text that references them.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been collected and repositioned just before the Index.</p>

<p>Some in-line paragraph headings are in boldface and some are in italics;
this emphasis has been retained.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references, but
<a href="#birdstails">a reference</a> to page 274 was a typographical error and has been changed to 174.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_155">155</a>: Text refers to <i>c c′</i> in <a href="#Fig_38">Figs.&nbsp;38&ndash;39</a>, but neither figure
appears to contain a <i>c′</i> label.</p>
